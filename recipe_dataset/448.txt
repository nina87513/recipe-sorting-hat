Extra-Easy Lasagna
1 pound lean ground beef
4 cups tomato-basil pasta sauce
6  uncooked lasagna noodles
1  (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese
2½ cups (10 ounces) shredded mozzarella cheese
¼ cup hot water
Cook beef in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring until it crumbles and is no longer pink; drain. Stir in pasta sauce.
Spread one-third of meat sauce in a lightly greased 11- x 7-inch baking dish; layer with 3 noodles and half each of ricotta cheese and mozzarella cheese. (The ricotta cheese layers will be thin.) Repeat procedure; spread remaining one-third of meat sauce over mozzarella cheese. Slowly pour 1/4 cup hot water around inside edge of dish. Tightly cover baking dish with 2 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil.
Bake at 375° for 45 minutes; uncover and bake 10 more minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
Note: For testing purposes only, we used Classico Tomato & Basil pasta sauce.
