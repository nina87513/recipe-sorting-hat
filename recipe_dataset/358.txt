Indian Lamb Curry
2 pounds boneless leg of lamb, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes
1  (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups finely chopped white onion
2 tablespoons grated peeled fresh ginger
2 teaspoons mustard seeds
2 teaspoons garam masala
2 teaspoons ground cumin
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground red pepper
4  garlic cloves, minced
4 cups hot cooked basmati rice
½ cup plain fat-free yogurt
½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add lamb; sauté 5 minutes or until browned. Remove lamb from pan; place in a 4-quart electric slow cooker.
Drain tomatoes, reserving juice. Place flour in a small bowl; gradually add tomato juice, stirring with a whisk until smooth. Stir tomatoes, tomato juice mixture, onion, and next 7 ingredients (through garlic) into lamb. Cover and cook on LOW for 8 hours or until lamb is tender. Serve lamb curry over rice; top with yogurt, and sprinkle with cilantro.
