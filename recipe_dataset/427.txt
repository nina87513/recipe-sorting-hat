Samosas
½ cup dried lentils
2  garlic cloves, minced
2  carrots, diced
1  medium onion, diced
½ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper
1  to 2 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2  to 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
9  egg roll wrappers
Vegetable oil
1  (9-ounce) jar mango chutney
Cook lentils according to package directions, adding garlic and next 6 ingredients; drain. Stir in cilantro.
Cut each wrapper into 4 squares; spoon about 1 teaspoon lentil mixture on half of each square. Moisten edges with water, and fold in half diagonally, pressing edges with a fork to seal.
Pour oil to depth of 1 inch into a large skillet or Dutch oven; heat to 375°. Fry, 3 at a time, 30 seconds or until golden, turning once, and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with mango chutney.
