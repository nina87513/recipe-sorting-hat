Korean Tteokguk (Rice Cake Soup)
1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
2 eggs, separated
1 sheet nori (dry seaweed)
5 cups thinly sliced garae tteok (Korean glutinous rice cakes)
32 fluid ounces Korean beef bone stock (such as OttogiÂ®)
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
2 green onions, thin sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Place nori in another skillet over medium heat; toast until bright green and crispy, about 30 seconds per side. Cut into thin strips.
Rinse rice cakes in cold water; drain.
Pour beef stock into a large pot; bring to a boil. Add rice cakes and garlic. Simmer until rice cake slices are tender, about 5 minutes. Add green onions; continue cooking until rice cakes start floating to the top, 3 to 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
Ladle soup into serving bowls. Garnish with egg and nori strips.
