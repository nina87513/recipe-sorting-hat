Falafel Fish with Israeli Salad
1  medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced
1  tomato (about 8 oz.), chopped
½  yellow bell pepper, seeded and diced
½  orange bell pepper, seeded and diced
1½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves, plus more leaves for topping
½ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon pepper
½ cup (3 oz.) falafel mix*
½ teaspoon ground cumin
¼ teaspoon cayenne
2  large eggs
4  cod fillets (about 6 oz. each)
 cup vegetable oil
Lemon wedges (optional)
Preheat oven to 400°. Combine cucumber, tomato, bell peppers, olive oil, lemon juice, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; set aside.
Mix falafel mix, cumin, and cayenne in a shallow bowl. Crack eggs into a second bowl and beat lightly. Dip fish fillets into egg, coating evenly, then into fa­lafel mix, also coating evenly; set on a plate.
Heat vegetable oil in an oven-proof frying pan over high heat. When oil begins to ripple, add fish and cook until crust is golden brown and crisp, turning once, about 3 minutes. Transfer pan to oven and roast fish until opaque in the center (cut one to check), 5 to 7 minutes.
Divide salad among four plates. Top each with a piece of fish and a few parsley leaves. Serve with lemon wedges if you like.
