Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and jalapeño; sauté 4 minutes or until tender. Stir in chili powder and next 4 ingredients (through cloves); cook 1 minute. Add pork; sauté 5 minutes or until pork is browned on all sides. Stir in raisins, tomato paste, salt, and tomatoes. Reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes or until most of liquid evaporates. Cool slightly.
Preheat oven to 425°.
Place the Savory Cornmeal-Whole Wheat Dough circles on lightly floured surface. Spoon 1/4 cup pork mixture into center of each circle. Fold dough over filling; press edges together with a fork or fingers to seal. Place empanadas on large baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Pierce the top of each once with a fork. Bake at 425° for 18 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm.
