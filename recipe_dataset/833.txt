Sloppy Lentils in Pita
1 tablespoon olive oil
¾ cup finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
8 ounces lean ground lamb
¾ cup dried brown lentils
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 cup water, divided
2 cups diced plum tomatoes or boxed diced tomatoes, undrained
1  bay leaf
4  (6-inch) whole-wheat pitas, cut in half
½ cup plain 2% Greek-style yogurt
1 cup thinly sliced cucumber
Chopped fresh mint (optional)
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and lamb; cook 5 minutes or until lamb is browned and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally to crumble lamb.
Add lentils, cumin, and thyme; stir until seasonings become fragrant. Add 1/2 cup water, tomatoes, and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and cook 15 minutes. Stir lentil mixture; add remaining 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook 15 minutes or until lentils are tender and mixture is thick (add additional water as needed). Discard bay leaf. Fill each pita half with 1/2 cup lentil mixture. Spoon 1 tablespoon yogurt into each pita half; top with 2 tablespoons cucumber. Sprinkle with mint, if desired.
