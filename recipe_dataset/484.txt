Prosciutto, Pear, and Blue Cheese Sushi
3 cups cooked brown rice
4 tablespoons rice vinegar
½ teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons pine nuts
4  sheets nori (seaweed)
4  slices prosciutto
2 tablespoons blue cheese
½ cup peeled, julienned pear
2 tablespoons balsamic glaze
Combine cooked rice, vinegar, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Toast and crush pine nuts; set aside.
Cover a sheet of aluminum foil with plastic wrap; top with 1 sheet nori. Press 3/4 cup seasoned rice onto nori, leaving a 1/4-inch border at the top and bottom. Press 1/2 tablespoon crushed pine nuts into the rice; top with 1 slice prosciutto, 1/2 tablespoon blue cheese, and 2 tablespoons pear.
Roll foil tightly toward you; remove foil and plastic wrap. Cut roll into 1-inch pieces with a sharp, wet knife.
Repeat steps with 3 more rolls. Drizzle pieces of each sushi roll evenly with 1 1/2 teaspoons balsamic glaze.
