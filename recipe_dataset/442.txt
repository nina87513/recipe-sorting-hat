My Secret Tomato Sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  canned anchovy fillets in oil, drained
3  garlic cloves, minced
½ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2  (14 1/2-ounce) cans no-salt-added whole tomatoes, undrained and finely chopped
Heat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add oil; swirl to coat. Add anchovy fillets and garlic. Cook 2 minutes, pressing anchovy fillets with the back of a spoon until smooth; stir constantly.
Stir in salt and remaining ingredients. Bring to a simmer; cook, uncovered, 15 minutes or until you reach the desired consistency, stirring occasionally.
