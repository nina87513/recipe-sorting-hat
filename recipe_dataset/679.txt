Goat Cheese Tamales with Olives and Raisins
16  dried corn husks
1 cup golden raisins
½ cup sliced green onions
¼ cup fat-free sour cream
¼ teaspoon salt
6  Spanish olives, coarsely chopped
2  egg whites
1  (3-ounce) log goat cheese
3 ounces fat-free cream cheese
2 cups Basic Masa Dough
2 cups hot water
Place corn husks in a large bowl; cover with water. Weight husks down with a can; soak 30 minutes. Drain husks.
Preheat oven to 450°.
Combine raisins and next 7 ingredients (through cream cheese), stirring well to combine. Working with one husk at a time, place 3 tablespoons Basic Masa Dough in the center of husk about 1/2 inch from top of husk; press dough into a 4-inch-long by 3-inch-wide rectangle. Spoon about 1 tablespoon cheese mixture down one side of dough. Using the corn husk as your guide, fold husk over tamale, being sure to cover filling with dough; fold over 1 more time. Fold bottom end of husk under. Place tamale, seam side down, on the rack of a broiler pan lined with a damp towel. Repeat procedure with remaining husks, Basic Masa Dough, and filling. Cover filled tamales with another damp towel. Pour 2 cups hot water in the bottom of a broiler pan; top with prepared rack.
Steam tamales at 450° for 55 minutes, adding water as necessary to maintain a depth of about 1/2 inch. Let tamales stand 10 minutes.
