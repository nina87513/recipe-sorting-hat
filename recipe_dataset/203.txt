To prepare frites, heat a large baking sheet in oven for 5 minutes. Combine potatoes, 1 tablespoon oil, and hot sauce in a large bowl. Add 3/4 teaspoon thyme and garlic salt; toss to combine. Remove preheated pan from oven. Coat pan with cooking spray. Arrange potatoes in a single layer on prepared pan. Bake at 500° for 40 minutes or until crisp, turning once after 20 minutes. Remove from oven; cover and keep warm.
Preheat broiler.
To prepare steak, let steak stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Combine 1/4 teaspoon salt and next 8 ingredients (through 1/8 teaspoon black pepper); sprinkle both sides of steak with spice blend. Place steak on a broiler pan coated with cooking spray; broil 6 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. Cover and let rest 5 minutes. Cut steak diagonally across grain into thin slices.
To prepare kale, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil and minced garlic; cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add kale and 1/4 cup water; cover and cook 5 minutes or until tender. Remove from heat; stir in vinegar and remaining ingredients. Arrange 1 cup kale and 3 ounces steak on each of 4 plates; divide frites evenly among servings.
