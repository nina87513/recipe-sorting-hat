Spiced Black Bean Hummus with Marinated Peaches
1  (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1  garlic clove
2 tablespoons tahini
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon Sriracha chili sauce
1  large lemon
Â½ teaspoon sea salt
1  firm ripe avocado
Sea salt
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon chopped parsley
1  ripe large peach
Freshly baked pita chips
Put black beans, garlic clove, tahini, olive oil, chili sauce, and the juice of 1 large lemon in a food processor; pulse until smooth. (If the hummus is too thick, you can drizzle in some of the black bean liquid from the can.) Season with 1/2 teaspoon sea salt. Transfer hummus to a bowl, and let chill. Meanwhile, dice avocado, and place into a small mixing bowl. Season with sea salt, 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, and chopped parsley. Dice peach, and add to avocado mixture; toss gently. To serve, place hummus into a serving dish, and top with marinated peaches and avocado. Serve with freshly baked pita chips.
