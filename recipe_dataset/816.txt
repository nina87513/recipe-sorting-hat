Israeli Roast Eggplant, Hummus and Pickle Sandwiches
1  (large) baking potato
Salt
1  (medium) eggplant, sliced 1/2 inch thick
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing
1  cucumber, peeled, halved, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice
1  (large) tomato, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1  (large) jalapeño, minced
2  garlic, minced
3 tablespoons cilantro, chopped
2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
2 tablespoons lemon juice, freshly squeezed
Freshly ground pepper
4  (thick) pita breads, warmed
1 cup hummus
¼ cup tahini, at room temperature
4  (large) hard-cooked eggs, sliced
4  (small) dill pickles, thinly sliced
Preheat the oven to 425°. In a small saucepan, cover the potato with 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Cook over moderate heat until just tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool, then peel the potato and slice it 1/4 inch thick. Season the potato slices with salt.
Meanwhile, arrange the eggplant slices on a rimmed baking sheet and brush both sides with olive oil. Season with salt and bake for about 10 minutes, until browned and tender.
In a large bowl, add the cucumber, tomato, jalapeño, garlic, cilantro and parsley. Toss with the lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
Cut off 2 inches from the side of the warm pitas to make openings in the pockets. Gently open the pitas. Spread the hummus on the bottoms and 1 tablespoon of tahini over it. Layer the potato slices, eggplant, egg and cucumber-tomato salad in the pitas, along with some of the salad juices. Top with the pickle slices and serve.
