Paella with Poblanos, Corn, and Clams
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups chopped yellow onion
3  garlic cloves, minced
2  poblano chiles, seeded and chopped
1¼ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
½ teaspoon black pepper, divided
¾ cup uncooked short-grain brown rice
¼ teaspoon saffron threads, crushed
2 cups water
.13 teaspoon ground red pepper
1½ cups fresh corn kernels (about 2 ears)
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
2 pounds littleneck clams
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
8  lemon wedges
Preheat oven to 450°.
Heat oil in a 12-inch ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, poblanos, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper; sauté 3 minutes. Add rice and saffron. Cook 2 minutes; stir constantly. Add 2 cups water, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and red pepper; bring to a boil.
Bake at 450° for 50 minutes or until rice is done. Stir in corn and tomatoes. Nestle clams into rice mixture. Bake at 450° for 12 minutes or until shells open, and discard unopened shells.
Return the pan to medium-high heat, and cook without stirring 10 minutes or until liquid evaporates and rice browns. (It should smell toasty but not burned.) Top with parsley; serve with lemon wedges.
