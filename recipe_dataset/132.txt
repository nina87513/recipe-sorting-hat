1 tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger
5  garlic cloves, minced
1 cup matchstick-cut carrot
2  (3.5-ounce) packages sliced fresh shiitake mushrooms
1 cup (1-inch) pieces green onions

Add carrot and mushrooms; cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add onions and cabbage; cook 1 to 2 minutes or just until cabbage wilts. Spoon cabbage mixture into a large bowl; stir in salt.
Wipe pan clean with paper towels. Return pan to medium-high heat. Combine sugar and pork, tossing well to coat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add pork mixture to pan; cook 3 minutes or until pork is browned and done, stirring occasionally. Carefully add 1 1/2 tablespoons water to pan, scraping pan to loosen browned bits.
