Hearty Arroz Con Pollo
½ cup all-purpose flour
1  (3 1/2- to 4-pound) broiler-fryer, cut up
½ cup vegetable oil
1  large onion, chopped
7  brown-and-serve sausage links, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1  (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, undrained
2  (4-ounce) jars chopped pimiento, drained
1  (3-ounce) jar pimiento-stuffed olives, drained
2 cups uncooked regular rice
1 cup water
2  chicken bouillon cubes
1½ teaspoons salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
1  (10-ounce) package frozen English peas
Place flour in a plastic or paper bag; add 2 or 3 pieces of chicken to bag, and shake well. Repeat procedure with remaining chicken. Heat oil in a Dutch oven; add chicken, and brown on all sides. Remove chicken, reserving oil in Dutch oven. Drain chicken on paper towels.
Sauté onion in reserved oil until tender. Add next 9 ingredients, stirring well. Place chicken pieces on top; cover and cook over medium heat 30 minutes. Stir mixture occasionally to prevent rice from sticking.
