Add wine, and cook 1 to 2 minutes or until liquid evaporates, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Add cheesecloth bag, tomatoes, and next 4 ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer, uncovered, 35 minutes.
While stew simmers, combine basil and next 4 ingredients in a food processor; process until smooth. Spoon pistou into a small bowl; set aside.
