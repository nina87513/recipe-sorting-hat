Take-Two Turkey Noodle Soup with Ginger and Chile
12 cups reduced-sodium or homemade chicken broth
About 2 oz. fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced (1/3 cup)
8 ounces cooked turkey
9 ounces fresh Chinese-style egg noodles or 5 oz. dried*
6 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced (2 1/2 cups)
6 ounces broccolini, large stems halved lengthwise, then all of it cut into 1-in. lengths
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1  to 1 1/2 tbsp. Asian chili garlic sauce
2 cups coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems
8  green onions, thinly sliced
Bring broth and ginger to a boil, covered, over high heat. Meanwhile, tear turkey into large shreds; set aside.
Add noodles, mushrooms, and broccolini to broth (if using dried noodles, cook noodles first for 2 minutes, then add vegetables). Cook noodles until almost tender, about 2 minutes for fresh and 4 to 5 minutes for dried.
Keep soup at a simmer and add turkey. Stir in hoisin and chili garlic sauces, then most of cilantro and green onions. Ladle into large, deep bowls and top with remaining cilantro and green onions.
*Find fresh noodles in the refrigerated section of most grocery stores and Asian markets, and dried noodles in your grocery store's Asian-foods aisle.
