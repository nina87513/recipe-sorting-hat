Rice and Beans with Chicken and Chorizo
1  (5-ounce) package lower-sodium yellow rice (such as Vigo)
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
1½ cups chopped seeded plum tomato
2 ounces Spanish chorizo sausage, diced
1  (15-ounce) can lower-sodium black beans, rinsed and drained
Cook rice according to package directions, omitting salt and fat. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; coat with cooking spray. Add chicken; sauté 7 minutes or until browned. Stir in tomato, 1/3 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and chorizo; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 6 minutes or until thickened. Stir in beans; cook 2 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Spoon 1/2 cup rice onto each of 4 plates; top each serving with 1 cup chicken mixture.
