Mushroom and Charred Corn Tacos with Guacamole
2  ripe peeled avocados
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 tablespoons finely chopped red onion
1½ tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
¼ cup Mexican crema
1 tablespoon adobo sauce (from canned chipotle chiles)
2 cups fresh yellow corn kernels (about 4 ears)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup finely chopped stemmed and seeded fresh poblano chile (about 2 medium poblanos)
4 cups sliced mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, shiitake, and oyster; about 8 ounces)
4  garlic cloves, minced
12  Fresh Corn Tortillas or packaged corn tortillas, warmed
6 tablespoons crumbled Cotija or feta cheese
Fresh cilantro leaves (optional)
Place avocados in a medium bowl; mash until smooth. Stir in chopped cilantro, onion, juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; set aside.
Combine crema and adobo in a small bowl, stirring until well blended; set aside.
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add corn to pan; cook 4 minutes or until corn is caramelized and lightly charred, stirring occasionally. Place corn in a large bowl.
Wipe pan clean with paper towels; return to medium-high heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add poblano; sauté 4 minutes or until tender. Add mushrooms and garlic; sauté 2 minutes. Stir in remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt; sauté mushroom mixture 4 minutes or until most of liquid evaporates. Add mushroom mixture to corn; stir to combine.
Place 2 warm tortillas on each of 6 plates. Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons avocado mixture in a 4-inch circle in center of each tortilla. Top each with 1/4 cup mushroom mixture, 1 1/2 teaspoons crema mixture, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cheese. Top with cilantro leaves, if desired.
