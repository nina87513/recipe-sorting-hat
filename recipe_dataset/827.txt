Baklava Tartlets
½ cup sugar
 cup water
¼ cup honey
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2  cinnamon sticks
6  green cardamom pods, lightly crushed, or 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional)
2 teaspoons brandy or cognac
¾ cup coarsely chopped walnuts, toasted
¾ cup coarsely chopped pecans, toasted
2  (1.9-ounce) packages mini phyllo tart shells (30 shells)
Combine first 5 ingredients and cardamom, if desired, in a heavy saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook 5 minutes. Remove from heat; strain and discard solids. Stir in brandy and nuts.
Arrange tart shells on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Divide nut mixture evenly among shells. Bake at 350° for 8 to 10 minutes or until pastry is golden. Store, uncovered, at room temperature until ready to serve.
