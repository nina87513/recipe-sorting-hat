Cauliflower Masala with Tofu
½ cup coconut milk
½ teaspoon garam masala
6 teaspoons coconut oil
1 pound cauliflower florets
1  medium onion, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
5  cloves garlic, minced (about 2 Tbsp.)
1  large jalapeño seeded and minced
2 teaspoons ground coriander
½ teaspoon cumin
½ teaspoon turmeric
¾ teaspoon kosher salt
1  7- or 8-oz. package prebaked tofu, cut into bite-size cubes
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
 cup chopped cilantro
Lime wedges, for serving
Naan, optional
In a small bowl, combine coconut milk and garam masala.
In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat 2 tsp. oil over medium-high heat until very hot; swirl to coat skillet. Add half of cauliflower and half of onion; cook, undisturbed, for 1 minute, then stir-fry for 1 minute. Transfer to a plate. Add another 2 tsp. oil; repeat with remaining cauliflower and onion.
Add remaining 2 tsp. oil, ginger, garlic and jalapeño to skillet. Stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in spices and salt; add 3/4 cup water. Return cauliflower and onion to skillet. Stir in tofu. Cover and steam until cauliflower is just tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir in peas and coconut milk mixture. Stir-fry until heated through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add cilantro. Serve with lime wedges and warm naan, if desired.
