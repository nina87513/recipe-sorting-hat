Falafel with Avocado Spread
Patties:
1  (15-ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
½ cup (2 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack cheese
¼ cup finely crushed baked tortilla chips (about 3/4 ounce)
2 tablespoons finely chopped green onions
1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro
.13 teaspoon ground cumin
1  large egg white
1½ teaspoons canola oil
Spread:
¼ cup mashed peeled avocado
2 tablespoons finely chopped tomato
1 tablespoon finely chopped red onion
2 tablespoons fat-free sour cream
1 teaspoon fresh lime juice
.13 teaspoon salt
Remaining ingredients:
2  (6-inch) pitas, each cut in half crosswise
4  thin red onion slices, separated into rings
Microgreens
To prepare patties, place pinto beans in a medium bowl; partially mash with a fork. Add cheese and next 5 ingredients (through egg white); stir until well combined. Shape bean mixture into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) oval patties.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add patties to pan; cook 3 minutes on each side or until patties are browned and thoroughly heated.
To prepare spread, combine avocado and next 5 ingredients (through salt), stirring well. Place 1 patty in each pita half. Spread about 2 tablespoons avocado spread over patty in each pita half; top with onions and greens.
