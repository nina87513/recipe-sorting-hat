Sesame Green Beans
2 pounds green beans, stemmed
3 tablespoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the green beans and cook, uncovered, until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain and set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients until well blended. Add the green beans and toss to combine well. Season to taste with freshly ground pepper.
