Fresh Thai Noodle Bowl
1  (8-ounce) package rice vermicelli noodles
1 teaspoon canola oil
1 tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger
4  garlic cloves, minced
3½ cups unsalted vegetable stock (such as Kitchen Basics)
2½ tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce
1 cup matchstick-cut carrots
1  red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1  small English cucumber, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
5 tablespoons chopped fresh mixed herbs (such as basil, mint, and cilantro)
6 tablespoons chopped unsalted, dry-roasted peanuts
2 teaspoons chili oil
Cook noodles according to package directions; drain.
Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add ginger and garlic; cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add stock and soy sauce; bring to a boil. Simmer 10 minutes.
Place carrots, bell pepper, and cucumber in a bowl; toss to combine. Divide noodles evenly among 4 serving bowls; top each serving with one-fourth of vegetable mixture. Pour about 3/4 cup warm stock mixture into each bowl. Sprinkle evenly with herbs and peanuts; drizzle chili oil over top.
