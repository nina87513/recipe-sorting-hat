Haroseth
4  firm, tart-sweet apples, such as Fuji or Gala, unpeeled
½ cup roasted unsalted almonds, roughly chopped
6  pitted Medjool dates, halved lengthwise and chopped (to yield about 1/2 cup)
¼ teaspoon ground ginger
¼ teaspoon cinnamon
¾ teaspoon orange zest (from 1 large orange)
Pinch of ground cloves
2 tablespoons tawny port
¼ cup lightly toasted sliced almonds
Chop 1 1/2 apples into 1/2-in. dice. Coarsely chop remaining 2 1/2 apples, put in a food processor with all remaining ingredients except sliced almonds, and pulse until blended but still quite coarse.
Turn mixture into a bowl and stir in diced apples. Sprinkle with sliced almonds just before serving.
Make ahead: Up to 1 day (except toasted almonds), chilled.
