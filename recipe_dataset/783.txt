Flank Steak Tacos with Avocado and Red Onion Salad
1  flank steak (about 1 lb.)
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1 teaspoon pepper, divided
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
2  ripe avocados, peeled, quartered, and thickly sliced crosswise
½  medium red onion, thinly sliced
½  jalapeño chile, thinly sliced
¼ cup loosely packed cilantro leaves
2 tablespoons lime juice
12  corn tortillas (6 in. wide)
Heat a grill to high (450° to 550°). Brush steak with 1 tbsp. oil, 1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper, and the smoked paprika. Grill steak, covered, turning once, 6 to 8 minutes total for medium-rare (cut to test). Lift to a cutting board and loosely cover with foil (keep grill on).
While steak rests, toss avocados, onion, jalapeño, cilantro, lime juice, remaining 2 tbsp. oil, and remaining 1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper in a large bowl.
Thinly slice steak against the grain. Quickly grill tortillas a few seconds on each side to warm them. Serve steak with salad and tortillas.
