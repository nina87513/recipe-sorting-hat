CHICKEN:
2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
¼ cup lime juice
 cup fish sauce
¼ cup soy sauce
¼ cup brown sugar, packed
4  garlic cloves, minced
3 tablespoons ginger, minced
SRIRACHA MAYO:

1½ cups matchstick carrots

3 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons garlic chili sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce
TACOS:
8  8-inch flour tortillas

For the chicken:
Combine all ingredients and allow the chicken to marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Meanwhile, make the Sriracha mayonnaise by combining all ingredients and mixing in a small bowl, set aside.
For the slaw, combine all ingredients and allow to marinate until served.
Once the chicken has finished marinating, heat a large non-stick skillet to medium-high heat. Place the chicken in the skillet and allow it to brown and caramelize on all sides, about 8-10 minutes. Once finished, remove and allow chicken to drain on a paper towel.
To assemble the tacos, heat a flour tortilla in oven or microwave, spoon in the chicken topping with slaw and Sriracha mayonnaise. Garnish with fresh cilantro.
