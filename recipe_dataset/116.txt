Barbecued Duck on Sweet-and-Sour Red Cabbage
Red Cabbage:
2 teaspoons olive oil
½ cup chopped red onion
6 cups thinly sliced red cabbage (about 1 pound)
2 cups matchstick-cut carrots
¼ cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
Duck:
2  (14-ounce) packages boneless whole duck breasts, thawed
¼ cup barbecue sauce
Prepare grill; set to medium heat.
To prepare cabbage, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook 5 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add cabbage and next 5 ingredients (cabbage through pepper). Cover and cook 5 minutes; stir well. Cook an additional 15 minutes or until cabbage is tender, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; keep warm.
To prepare duck, brush meat side of breasts with barbecue sauce; place on grill rack, skin side up. Cook 8 minutes. Turn duck over; brush with remaining barbecue sauce. Cook 8 minutes or until desired degree of doneness; remove from heat, and let stand 5 minutes. Carefully remove skin from breasts; cut each breast in half. Cut each breast half into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Spoon cabbage onto plates; arrange duck around cabbage.
