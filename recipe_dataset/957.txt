Shrimp Pad Thai
12 ounces rice vermicelli noodles
 cup peanut or vegetable oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
8 ounces (30 to 35 per lb.) raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
5  green onions, cut into 2-in. pieces
1 tablespoon dried shrimp*, minced
2 cups bean sprouts, divided
 cup Vietnamese or Thai fish sauce
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon red chile flakes
2  large eggs, slightly beaten
Â½ cup cilantro leaves
 cup chopped roasted unsalted peanuts (optional)
6  to 8 lime wedges
Sriracha* (Asian red chile sauce; optional)
Soak vermicelli noodles in a bowl of very hot water until soft, about 15 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking.
Meanwhile, heat a large wok or frying pan over high heat. Pour in oil and carefully swirl to coat sides. Add garlic, shrimp, and green onions and cook 2 minutes, stirring often. Stir in dried shrimp, 1 cup bean sprouts, the fish sauce, ketchup, sugar, and chile flakes. Push shrimp mixture to one side of pan and carefully pour eggs onto other side, trying to coat pan evenly. Let cook undisturbed 1 minute, then quickly scramble with other ingredients.
Drain noodles and add to egg mixture. Cook until noodles start to brown slightly, 3 to 4 minutes, stirring once or twice.
Transfer to plates. Top with remaining bean sprouts, the cilantro, and peanuts. Serve with lime wedges and Sriracha.
