1  15.5-oz. can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper
Zest of 1 lemon
6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano, or 1 1/4 tsp. dried
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves, or 1 1/4 tsp. dried
4 cups chopped romaine lettuce
2  cucumbers, cut into 1-inch pieces

Place fennel seeds in a medium skillet over medium heat and cook, tossing, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chickpeas and 1 Tbsp. oil. Season with salt; sauté until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to cool. In a separate large bowl, whisk remaining oil with lemon zest and lemon juice, oregano and mint. Season with salt and pepper.
Toss lettuce in a third bowl with 2 Tbsp. dressing. Arrange lettuce on a large platter. In the same bowl, toss chickpea mixture with 2 Tbsp. dressing. On top of lettuce, arrange each of remaining ingredients in rows. Serve with remaining dressing on the side.
