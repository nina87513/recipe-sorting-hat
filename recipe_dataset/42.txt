Pork-and-Pineapple Fried Rice
¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
3 tablespoons canola oil
4 ounces ground pork
3  (5 ounces) small Chinese sausages, thinly sliced, see Note
3  scallions, white parts minced and green parts sliced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
½ teaspoon minced garlic
1  hot red chile, seeded and minced
4 cups cold cooked jasmine rice or other long-grain white rice
¼ cup cilantro leaves
¼ cup finely diced fresh pineapple
In a small bowl, whisk the soy sauce with the hoisin and vinegar. Heat a wok or large skillet. Add the oil and heat until smoking. Add the pork and Chinese sausages and cook over high heat, stirring, until the pork is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the minced scallion whites, ginger, garlic and chile and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the rice, breaking up any lumps with your hands as you add it to the wok, and stir-fry until heated through and lightly browned in spots. Stir the hoisin-soy sauce, add it to the wok and stir-fry until nearly absorbed, about 2 minutes. Stir in the scallion greens, cilantro and pineapple. Transfer the fried rice to bowls and serve.
