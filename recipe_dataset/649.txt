Sweet Potato Empanadas
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening
¾ cup cold beer
Sweet Potato Filling
½ cup sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
Combine flour and salt; cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in beer with a fork until well blended.
Roll dough to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut dough into 5-inch circles. Place a rounded tablespoon of Sweet Potato Filling in center of each circle; moisten edges with water. Fold pastry in half, making sure edges are even. Using a fork dipped in flour, press edges of pastry together to seal.
Place empanadas on baking sheets. Bake at 400° for 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Combine sugar and cinnamon, and sprinkle over hot empanadas.
