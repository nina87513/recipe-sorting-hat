Hand-Rolled Sushi
Sushi Rice
Sushi Fillings
With scissors, cut nori into quarters (about 4 in. square).
Dot a square of nori with wasabi if desired, then spoon a rounded tablespoon of Sushi Rice diagonally down the center. Top with two or three Sushi Fillings. Moisten one corner of nori with vinegar-water mixture, pull opposite corners around fillings to form a cone, and overlap to seal.
