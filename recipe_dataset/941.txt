Pad Thai
4 ounces wide rice noodles or linguine
¼ cup warm water
1 tablespoon seedless tamarind paste*
3 tablespoons light brown sugar
3 tablespoons fish sauce
1  to 2 teaspoons chili-garlic sauce
3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon stir-fry oil or vegetable oil, divided
3  garlic cloves, minced
½ pound peeled and deveined shrimp with tails
1  egg, lightly beaten
2  carrots, cut into thin strips
3  green onions, coarsely chopped
1 cup bean sprouts
¼ cup peanuts, chopped
¼ cup very lightly packed fresh cilantro leaves
Lime wedges
Cook noodles according to package directions; drain, and set aside.
Combine warm water and tamarind paste in a 2-cup measuring cup, stirring until dissolved. Stir in brown sugar, fish sauce, and chili-garlic sauce. Set aside.
Heat wok over high heat until a few drops of water evaporate immediately. Swirl 2 tablespoons oil in pan to coat. (If using a nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.) Add garlic; cook 30 seconds. Add shrimp, and cook, stirring often, 3 minutes or until done. Transfer shrimp to a plate.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in wok over high heat (medium-high, if using a nonstick skillet). Add reserved noodles and half of sauce mixture. Cook 1 minute, separating noodles with tongs.
Push noodles to edges of wok, forming a well in the center. Pour remaining 1 teaspoon oil into well; pour egg into oil, and cook, stirring, until done. Stir in carrots, green onions, remaining sauce mixture, and 1/2 cup bean sprouts. Cook 1 to 2 minutes or until heated through. Top with peanuts, cilantro, and remaining 1/2 cup bean sprouts; serve immediately with lime wedges.
*Tamarind paste adds bright, sour flavor to this iconic noodle dish. Substitute fresh lemon or lime juice, if necessary.
