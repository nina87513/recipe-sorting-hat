Yellow Tomato Gazpacho in Cucumber Cups
2  garlic cloves
1  scallion, white and green parts, cut into 1-inch pieces
5 pounds yellow tomatoes, cored and seeded
2  yellow bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into chunks
3 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
4  hothouse cucumbers
Place garlic, scallion, tomatoes, and bell peppers in a food processor; pulse until the vegetables are small chopped pieces. Add rice vinegar, kosher salt, and black pepper; chill. Cut cucumbers crosswise into 1-inch pieces; use a melon-baller to make small cups (be careful not to break through bottoms of cucumbers). Spoon gazpacho into cucumber cups; serve.
