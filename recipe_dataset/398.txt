Reduced Milk with Cardamom and Mango (Maangai Pal Paysam)
6 cups whole milk
 cup uncooked basmati rice
½ cup nonfat sweetened condensed milk
½ teaspoon ground cardamom
¼ teaspoon salt
2 cups chopped peeled mango (about 2 large)
Combine whole milk and basmati rice in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium, and gently boil 40 minutes or until mixture thickens. (Mixture will be a chowderlike consistency.) Stir in sweetened condensed milk, cardamom, and salt; cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Spoon 1/2 cup rice mixture into each of 8 dessert bowls. Top each serving with 1/4 cup chopped mango.
