Lentil Dal Wraps
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cups vertically sliced Vidalia or other sweet onion
1 cup dried small red lentils
1 tablespoon chopped peeled fresh ginger
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
1  cinnamon stick
2 cups water, divided
1 cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice
½ teaspoon salt
4  (1.4-ounce) flatbreads (such as Flatout)
¼ cup plain fat-free yogurt
½ cup julienne-cut cucumber
Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook 5 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add lentils, ginger, pepper, and cinnamon; cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in 1 cup water and broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup water and juice, and cook 30 minutes or until thick, stirring occasionally. Stir in salt. Remove cinnamon stick; cool lentil mixture completely. Spread about 1/2 cup mixture over each flatbread. Spread 1 tablespoon yogurt over each serving; divide cucumber evenly among flatbreads. Roll up. Cover and chill.
