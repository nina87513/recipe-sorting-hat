Goan Shrimp Curry
3  dried red chiles
¼ cup dried unsweetened coconut flakes
1½ teaspoons coriander seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1  1-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
4  garlic cloves, chopped
1 teaspoon tamarind concentrate or 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, see Note
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  small onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice
2  jalapeños, halved lengthwise
1 pound shelled and deveined medium shrimp
1 tablespoon malt or cider vinegar
Salt
In a large nonstick skillet, cook the dried chiles, coconut, coriander and cumin over moderately high heat, shaking the skillet, until the coconut starts to brown, 1 minute; transfer to a blender. Add the ginger, garlic, tamarind and 1/2 cup of water and puree.
In the same skillet, heat the oil. Add the onion and jalapeños and cook over moderately high heat until the onion is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add the puree and bring to a boil. Add the shrimp and cook over moderately low heat, turning a few times, until just white throughout, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the vinegar. Season with salt and serve right away.
