Cranberry and Dark Cherry Clafoutis
½ cup dried sweetened cranberries
2¼ ounces (about 1/2 cup) all-purpose flour
 cup sugar
.13 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup 2% reduced-fat milk
 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon orange liqueur
¼ teaspoon almond extract
2  large eggs
1  large egg yolk
1  large egg white, beaten to soft peaks
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup frozen pitted dark sweet cherries, thawed and shaken of excess moisture
½ cup part-skim ricotta cheese
1 tablespoon sugar
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
.13 teaspoon kosher salt
2  tangerines
Preheat oven to 400°.
Place cranberries in a small bowl; cover with boiling water. Let stand 10 minutes; drain.
Weigh or lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Combine flour, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon salt.
Whisk together milk, cream, liqueur, almond extract, 2 eggs, and 1 yolk.
Gradually sift flour mixture into milk mixture, whisking until smooth. Fold in egg white. Set aside.
Heat a 10-inch ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add butter; swirl until butter melts. Add cherries and cranberries; sauté 3 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat. Pour batter evenly over fruit mixture.
Bake at 400° for 14 minutes or until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in center comes out mostly clean. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
Combine ricotta, 1 tablespoon sugar, cinnamon, and 1/8 teaspoon salt.
Grate 1/2 teaspoon rind from tangerines; stir into ricotta mixture.
Cut tangerines into sections; discard membranes. Top warm clafoutis with ricotta mixture and tangerine sections.
