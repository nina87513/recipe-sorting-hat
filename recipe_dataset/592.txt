Toasted Guajillo and Pork Posole
3  dried guajillo chiles
1½ pounds pork shoulder, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
½ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon canola oil
3 cups fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
3 cups water
2 teaspoons ground cumin
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
3  garlic cloves, crushed
1  medium onion, cut into 4 wedges
1  (7-ounce) can chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
1  (29-ounce) can hominy, rinsed and drained
Preheat oven to 400°.
Place chiles on a baking sheet; bake at 400° for 4 minutes or until dark. Cool; remove stems and seeds.
Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add pork to pan; cook 5 minutes or until browned. Remove pork from pan. Wipe drippings from pan; return pork to pan. Add broth and next 5 ingredients (through onion), scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Add guajillo chiles and 1 tablespoon adobo sauce; reserve remaining chipotle chiles and sauce for another use. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours or until pork is tender.
Remove chiles, onion, garlic, and 1 cup cooking liquid; place in a blender. Remove center piece of blender lid (to allow steam to escape); secure blender lid on blender. Place a clean towel over opening in blender lid (to avoid splatters). Blend until smooth; return to pan. Stir in hominy; cook 10 minutes.
