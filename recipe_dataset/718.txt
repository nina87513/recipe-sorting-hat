Posole (Tomatillo, Chicken, and Hominy Soup)
1 pound tomatillos
6 cups Brown Chicken Stock
2 cups chopped onion
3 pounds chicken breast halves, skinned
4  garlic cloves, chopped
2  jalapeño peppers, seeded and quartered
1  (30-ounce) can white hominy, drained
1 teaspoon salt
½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
¼ cup reduced-fat sour cream
8  lime wedges
Discard husks and stems from the tomatillos. Cook whole tomatillos in boiling water 10 minutes or until tender; drain. Place tomatillos in a blender; process until smooth; set aside.
Place stock and the next 5 ingredients (stock through hominy) in a large stockpot; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 35 minutes or until chicken is done. Remove chicken from bones; shred. Stir in pureed tomatillos and salt; cook for 5 minutes or until heated. Stir in chicken, and serve with cilantro, sour cream, and lime wedges.
