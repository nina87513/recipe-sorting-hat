Quick Chicken Cassoulet
1 cup fresh or dried bread crumbs
2½ tablespoons olive oil
 cup minced shallots
4  cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1  carrot (about 4 oz.), peeled and diced (1/4 in.)
2  cans (15 oz. each) small white beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup 1-inch chunks cooked chicken (see note above)
8 ounces cooked chicken or duck sausages, sliced crosswise 1/4 inch thick
1  can (14 oz.) diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
1  dried whole bay leaf
½ cup fat-skimmed chicken broth
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
In a bowl, mix bread crumbs and 2 tablespoons oil until well combined.
Pour remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil into a 3-quart ovenproof pan over medium heat. When hot, add shallots, garlic, and carrot and stir occasionally until carrot is tender, about 7 minutes. Add beans, chicken, sausages, tomatoes, herbes de Provence, bay leaf, chicken broth, salt, and pepper; stir until well combined.
Cover and bake in a 350° regular or convection oven until beans are hot, about 30 minutes; uncover and sprinkle top evenly with bread-crumb mixture. Bake until top is browned and edges are bubbling, about 20 minutes longer.
