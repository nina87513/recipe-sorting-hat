Yummy Korean Glass Noodles (Jap Chae)
1 pkg. (8 serving size) sweet potato vermicelli
½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
¼ cup brown sugar
½ cup boiling water

Break the vermicelli into small pieces and place in a deep-sided dish. Cover with hot tap water and soak for ten minutes; drain.
Whisk together the soy sauce, brown sugar, and boiling water; pour over the drained noodles; allow to soak 2 minutes.
