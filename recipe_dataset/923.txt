Saucy Chorizo and Egg Skillet
4  (1 1/4-ounce) slices whole-grain country bread
Cooking spray
3  garlic cloves, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
1½ cups sliced onion
1  red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
½ teaspoon ground cumin
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon ground red pepper
2 cups strained unsalted tomatoes (such as Pomi) or canned unsalted crushed tomatoes
2 cups cooked chorizo (from Chorizo and Kale-Stuffed Sweet Potatoes with Zucchini-Arugula Salad)
4  large eggs
2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh cilantro
Preheat broiler to high.
Arrange bread on a baking sheet; coat both sides of bread with cooking spray. Broil 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Cut 1 garlic clove in half; rub bread slices with cut sides of garlic.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; sauté 3 minutes. Mince remaining 2 garlic cloves. Add minced garlic and bell pepper to pan; cook 5 minutes. Stir in cumin, salt, and ground red pepper; cook 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and chorizo; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes.
Uncover and form 4 (2-inch) indentations in sauce, using the back of a spoon. Crack eggs, 1 at a time, into a small custard cup, and gently slip 1 egg into each indentation. Cover and cook 8 minutes or until whites are set. Top with cilantro. Place 1 bread slice on each of 4 plates; top each with 1 1/2 cups sauce and 1 egg.
