Chicken Enchiladas with Green Salsa
4 tablespoons canola oil
2  small zucchini, diced
1  small red onion, chopped
1  ear of corn, kernels cut off the cob (about 1/2 cup)
1  2 1/2- to 3-pound rotisserie chicken, meat shredded
1½ cups (6 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack
Kosher salt and pepper
12  6-inch corn tortillas
1 pound tomatillos, husks removed
1  jalapeño, seeded
1 cup fresh cilantro leaves
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
½ cup sour cream (optional)
Heat oven to 400° F. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini, onion, and corn and cook, stirring, until the onion begins to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the chicken, Monterey Jack, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Mix to combine. Wipe out the skillet and heat the remaining oil over medium heat. One at a time, cook the tortillas in the oil until softened, 10 to 15 seconds per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Divide the chicken mixture among the tortillas, roll them up, and place seam-side down in a large baking dish. Bake until heated through, 8 to 10 minutes. In a food processor, pulse the tomatillos, jalapeño, cilantro, lime juice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until finely chopped. Serve the enchiladas with the salsa and sour cream, if using.
