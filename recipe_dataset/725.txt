Chiles Rellenos Casserole
2 teaspoons canola oil
½ pound ground chicken
1 cup chopped onion
1¾ teaspoons ground cumin
1½ teaspoons dried oregano
½ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1  (16-ounce) can vegetarian refried beans
1  (4-ounce) cans whole green chiles, drained and cut lengthwise into quarters
Cooking spray
1 cup (4 ounces) shredded colby-Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup frozen whole kernel corn, thawed and drained
 cup all-purpose flour
¼ teaspoon salt
1 cups fat-free milk
.13 teaspoon hot sauce
2  eggs, lightly beaten
2  egg whites
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add chicken and onion; cook 6 minutes or until chicken is done, stirring to crumble. Combine chicken mixture, cumin, and next 5 ingredients (through refried beans) in a bowl.
Arrange half of green chile strips in bottom of an 11 x 7-inch glass or ceramic baking dish coated with cooking spray; top with half of cheese. Spoon mounds of bean mixture onto cheese, and spread gently, leaving a 1/4-inch border around edge of dish; top with corn. Arrange remaining chile strips over corn; top with remaining cheese.
Combine flour and salt in a bowl; gradually add milk and hot sauce, stirring with a whisk until blended. Stir in eggs and egg whites; pour milk mixture over chile strips. Bake at 350° for 1 hour and 5 minutes or until set; let stand 5 minutes.
