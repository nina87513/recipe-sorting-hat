3  (4-ounce) chorizo sausages, sliced 1 inch thick
1  onion, cut into large chunks

White Wine Marinade
Thread first 3 ingredients and bay leaves, if desired, onto 10 (12-inch) skewers. Place in a shallow container; pour White Wine Marinade over kebabs. Cover and chill 4 to 8 hours, turning occasionally.
