Vegetable and Chicken Lo Mein
¾ pound fresh Chinese egg noodles (lo mein)*
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
¼ cup hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
4 teaspoons minced garlic
 cup thinly sliced green onions
1 cup coarsely shredded carrots
1 cup thinly sliced celery
1 cup thinly sliced red onion
1½ cups chopped cooked chicken or tofu
¾ cup mung-bean sprouts
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
Cook noodles in a large pot of salted boiling water until just tender to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and mix with sesame oil. In a small bowl, combine hoisin and soy sauce.
Pour 1 tbsp. canola oil into a 12-in. nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add ginger, garlic, green onions, carrots, celery, and red onion, and stir often just until softened, 2 to 4 minutes. Add chicken and bean sprouts and stir just until warm. Turn out into a bowl and keep warm.
Wipe frying pan clean. Pour remaining 1 tbsp. oil into pan over medium heat. Add noodles; stir and turn occasionally until light brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
Pour hoisin mixture and chicken mixture over noodles, add cilantro, and mix gently.
