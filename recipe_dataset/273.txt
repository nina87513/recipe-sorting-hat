Nicoise-style Crudites
12  fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise (about 14 oz.)
¼ cup plus 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, divided
½ pound haricots verts (French green beans)
¼ cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
1  small shallot, finely chopped
1  small garlic clove, finely grated
2 teaspoons whole-grain Dijon mustard
½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
¼ cup finely chopped pitted Nicoise olives
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
¾ teaspoon black pepper, divided
3  plum tomatoes, cut into wedges
1  head Belgian endive, separated into leaves
2  Persian cucumbers, diagonally sliced (about 4 oz.)
3  hard-boiled eggs, halved
Place potatoes in a medium saucepan. Add 1/4 cup salt and water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high; reduce heat to low, and simmer 8 to 10 minutes or until just tender, adding haricots verts during the last 2 minutes of cook time. Drain vegetables, and plunge into ice water to stop the cooking process.
Stir together lemon juice, shallot, garlic, and mustard in a medium bowl. Let stand 5 minutes. Whisk in olive oil, olives, and parsley. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
Drain potatoes and haricots verts, and pat dry with paper towels. Arrange cooked vegetables, tomatoes, endive leaves, cucumbers, and eggs on a serving board; sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Serve with vinaigrette.
