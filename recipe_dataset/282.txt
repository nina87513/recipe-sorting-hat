Cranberry-Pear Clafoutis
½ cup dried sweetened cranberries
2¼ ounces (about 1/2 cup) all-purpose flour
 cup sugar
.13 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup 2% reduced-fat milk
 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon orange liqueur
2  large eggs
1  large egg yolk
1  large egg white, beaten to soft peaks
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup chopped peeled ripe Anjou pear
1 tablespoon powdered sugar
1 ounce crumbled blue cheese
¼ cup chopped toasted walnuts
Preheat oven to 400°.
Place cranberries in a small bowl; cover with boiling water. Let stand 10 minutes; drain.
Weigh or lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Combine flour, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon salt.
Whisk together milk, cream, liqueur, 2 eggs, and 1 yolk.
Gradually sift flour mixture into milk mixture, whisking until smooth. Fold in egg white. Set aside.
Heat a 10-inch ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add butter; swirl until butter melts. Add pear; sauté 3 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat. Pour batter evenly over fruit mixture.
Bake at 400° for 14 minutes or until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in center comes out mostly clean. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
Garnish warm clafoutis with powdered sugar, blue cheese, and walnuts.
