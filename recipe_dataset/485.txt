About 6 cups vegetable oil for frying
1¼ cups cake flour

¼ teaspoon cayenne
About 1 lb. precut vegetables, such as peppers, mushrooms, and broccoli florets from the salad bar or a stir-fry mix
½ cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
Heat oil in a wide pot over high heat until it reaches 350° on a deep-fry thermometer. Reduce heat to low. Whisk flour, beer, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne together in a medium bowl. Working in 2 batches and using tongs, drop vegetables into batter and then into oil. Fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
