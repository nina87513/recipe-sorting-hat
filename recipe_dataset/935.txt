Picadillo-stuffed Mashed Potato Balls
1 cup whole-wheat panko
2 cups leftover Mom's Smashed Mashed Potatoes
½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
2 teaspoons canola oil
1  garlic clove, minced
¼ pound 90% lean ground beef
2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
3 tablespoons chopped golden raisins
3 tablespoons chopped pitted green olives
2 tablespoons leftover Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy
Cooking spray
4 cups lightly packed arugula
1½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
Lemon wedges (optional)
Preheat oven to 425°.
Place panko in a dry skillet over medium-high heat; cook 3 minutes or until panko is toasted, stirring occasionally.
Place Mom's Smashed Mashed Potatoes in a food processor; pulse until smooth. Add 1/4 cup panko and 1/4 teaspoon salt to potatoes, and pulse just until combined.
Heat canola oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Add beef, oregano, and cumin. Increase heat to medium-high; cook 2 minutes, stirring to crumble. Remove from heat; stir in remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, raisins, olives, and Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy.
Place remaining 3/4 cup panko in a shallow dish. Line a jelly-roll pan with foil, and coat with cooking spray. Working with 3 tablespoons potato mixture, shape potato mixture around 1 heaping tablespoon beef filling to form a ball. Roll in panko to coat. Place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat procedure with remaining potato mixture and beef filling to make 12 balls. Coat potato balls with cooking spray. Bake at 425° for 20 minutes or until golden.
Combine arugula, olive oil, and juice in a large bowl; toss to coat. Serve salad with potato balls and lemon wedges, if desired.
