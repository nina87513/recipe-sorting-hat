¾ cup water, divided
 cup rice vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
4  garlic cloves, minced and divided
2 tablespoons dry sherry
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons finely chopped hot red chile (with seeds), such as red jalapeño or Thai chile
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1½ tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
½ teaspoon salt
1  red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
2  carrots, diagonally cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices
1  (8-ounce) bunch Broccolini, cut into florets and stems cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 cups cooked brown rice
Place tofu in a shallow dish. Place plastic wrap on top, and weight with a heavy pan; let stand 20 minutes. Discard liquid, and cut tofu into 2 x 1/4-inch pieces.
Combine 1/2 cup water, vinegar, and sugar in a small pan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Stir half of garlic into sugar mixture. Stir in sherry, ketchup, and chile. Cook mixture over medium heat until boiling. Remove from heat; stir in cornstarch, stirring with a whisk until smooth. Stir in soy sauce.
Heat a large cast-iron skillet or wok over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil; swirl to coat. Add tofu in an even layer; cook, without stirring, 2 minutes. Turn tofu; cook 2 minutes. Place on a plate; sprinkle with salt.
Add 1 teaspoon oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add bell pepper; stir-fry 2 minutes. Add remaining garlic; stir-fry 10 to 20 seconds. Remove to plate with tofu. Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add carrots; stir-fry 1 minute. Add Broccolini; stir-fry 3 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup water; cook 3 minutes or until water evaporates. Return tofu mixture to pan. Add sauce mixture; stir to coat. Divide rice among 4 plates. Divide tofu mixture evenly over rice.
