Spicy Lamb Tacos
3 cups thinly sliced cabbage (from 1 medium head)
1  bunch radishes, sliced into half-moons
½ teaspoon cumin seeds
¼ cup cilantro leaves
3 tablespoons lime juice
Salt
1 pound ground lamb
2  garlic cloves, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1 teaspoon ancho chile powder
½  to 1 tsp. chipotle chile powder
¼ cup beer
1 teaspoon cider vinegar
8  warm corn tortillas
Toppings such as crumbled queso fresco (fresh Mexican cheese), crema (Mexican sour cream) or sour cream, chopped cilantro, pickled jalapeños, and lime wedges for squeezing
Combine cabbage, radishes, cumin, cilantro, and lime juice in a large bowl. Add salt to taste and transfer to a serving bowl.
Sauté lamb, garlic, and oregano in a large frying pan over high heat, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon until very little pink remains, about 5 minutes. Drain excess fat. Add chile powders, beer, vinegar, and salt to taste and cook, stirring, until most liquid has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a serving bowl.
Set out tortillas and toppings in separate bowls and let everyone make their own tacos.
Make ahead: Cook meat and prep toppings the night before.
