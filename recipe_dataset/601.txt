½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½ teaspoon rubbed sage
6  (5-ounce) chicken thighs, skinned
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups chopped sweet onion (about 2 medium)
1½ cups chopped celery (about 6 stalks)
¼ cup seeded and chopped poblano chile (about 1 small)
6  garlic cloves, minced
1  (14-ounce) can fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
¼ cup water
1¼ cups uncooked jasmine rice
Combine first 3 ingredients; sprinkle evenly over chicken thighs.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs, and cook 3 minutes on each side or until browned; remove from pan, and set aside.
Add onion, celery, and poblano to pan; cook 6 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute. Add broth and water; bring to a boil, and stir in rice. Return chicken to pan; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and chicken is done. Remove from heat; let stand 5 minutes.
