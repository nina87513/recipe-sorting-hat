Fried Ricotta with Epazote and Green Chile
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
½ cup minced white onion
2 cups ricotta, preferably the fresh, curd-style type, drained of excess liquid
1 teaspoon medium-fine sea salt or kosher salt
  to 1/2 cup roughly chopped epazote leaves
1  to 2 tbsp. finely chopped green serrano, jalapeño, or arbol chile
In a large frying pan over medium-high heat, sauté onion in oil, stirring often, until translucent, about 3 minutes.
Add ricotta and fry, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until dryish, 6 to 10 minutes (the bottom of the pan will probably get a little brown). Stir in salt and remove from heat. Stir in epazote and chile.
