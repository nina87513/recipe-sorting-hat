Pita Bread Salad
2  (6-inch) whole-wheat pitas, each cut into 10 wedges
Cooking spray
1½ teaspoons za'atar
½ teaspoon salt, divided
¾ teaspoon chopped garlic
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
½ teaspoon ground sumac
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 cups chopped cucumber
2 cups chopped tomato
½ cup loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
¼ cup thinly diagonally sliced green onions
¼ cup loosely packed fresh mint, chopped
¼ teaspoon black pepper
Preheat oven to 350°.
Arrange pita wedges in a single layer on a baking sheet; lightly coat with cooking spray. Sprinkle pita evenly with za'atar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bake at 350° for 15 minutes or until crisp and golden. Cool and break into 1-inch pieces.
Combine remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and garlic on a dry surface. Mash with the side of a knife to form a paste. Combine garlic mixture, juice, and sumac in a large bowl; stir with a whisk. Slowly whisk in olive oil. Add cucumber and remaining ingredients to bowl; toss well to coat. Let stand 10 minutes. Add pita pieces; toss well to coat. Serve immediately.
