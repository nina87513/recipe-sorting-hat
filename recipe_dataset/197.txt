Chicken Cordon Bleu
 cup dry breadcrumbs
½ teaspoon caraway seeds
4  (4-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 ounces thinly sliced low-fat deli ham
2 ounces thinly sliced Swiss cheese
4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
Olive oil-flavored cooking spray
Preheat oven to 425°.
Combine breadcrumbs and caraway seeds in a shallow dish. Set aside.
Cut a horizontal slit through thickest portion of each chicken breast half to form a pocket; place ham and cheese evenly into pockets.
Spread 1 teaspoon of mustard over each chicken breast, coating both sides. Dredge each breast in breadcrumb mixture, pressing firmly to coat. Coat lightly with cooking spray.
Place chicken in a 13 x 9-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, at 425° for 22 to 25 minutes or until chicken is done. Serve immediately.
