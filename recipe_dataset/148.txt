Pulled Pork Lettuce Wraps
2 tablespoons sugar
2¼ teaspoons kosher salt
1  (2 1/2-pound) boneless pork shoulder, trimmed
1 tablespoon grated peeled fresh ginger
2 tablespoons sherry or white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted chicken stock (such as Swanson)
1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean chile paste)
1½ teaspoons lower-sodium soy sauce
¼ cup thinly sliced green onions
30  Boston lettuce leaves (about 2 heads)
1 cup thinly sliced radishes
Lime wedges (optional)
Combine sugar and salt in a small bowl. Place pork in a large bowl; rub evenly with sugar mixture. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 300°. Place pork on a rack set inside a roasting pan. Place pan in oven; bake 4 hours or until a thermometer registers 210°, basting occasionally with drippings. Remove from oven; let stand 30 minutes. Shred pork with 2 forks.
Combine ginger and next 5 ingredients (through soy sauce), stirring with a whisk. Stir in onions. Reserve half of sauce. Toss shredded pork in remaining half of sauce. Divide pork evenly among lettuce leaves. Top with radishes; drizzle with reserved sauce. Serve with lime wedges, if desired.
