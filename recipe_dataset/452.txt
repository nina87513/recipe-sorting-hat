Hot Italian Sausage and Tomato Pasta
1 pound dry fettuccine
3 tablespoons olive oil
1  medium red onion, sliced
1  clove garlic, smashed
4  hot Italian sausages, casings removed
1  pint red or yellow cherry tomatoes
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
¾ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
½ cup fresh basil leaves, torn
1 cup arugula, torn
¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan
Cook the fettuccine according to the package directions. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion softens, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the sausage and cook about 5 minutes, using a wooden spoon to crumble it. Add the tomatoes and cook until the skins burst, about 8 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, salt, and pepper. Add the cooked fettuccine, basil, and arugula and toss gently to combine. Serve in bowls and top with the Parmesan.Tip: Vegetarians can omit the sausage. Try adding 3/4 cup Feta cheese to the pasta and greens.
