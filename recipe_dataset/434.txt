Tofu Saag
21 ounces firm water-packed tofu, cut into 1-inch squares
2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
10 ounce baby spinach, stemmed
10 ounce baby kale, stemmed
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
8  green cardamom pods
6  whole cloves
3  dried red chiles de arbol
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
¼ teaspoon asafetida (optional)
¾ teaspoon kosher salt
1½ tablespoons ghee or canola oil
¾ teaspoon cumin seeds
½ teaspoon fennel seeds
3  dried red chiles de arbol
.13 teaspoon asafetida (optional)
.13 teaspoon ground red pepper
1 teaspoon water
Briefly pat tofu dry with paper towels (about 5 seconds). Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of tofu to pan; cook 4 minutes or until golden, turning once. Drain tofu on paper towels. Repeat procedure with 1 1/2 teaspoons oil and remaining tofu.
Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in a large Dutch oven. Add baby spinach and baby kale; cover and cook 4 minutes or until wilted, stirring occasionally. Drain well, reserving cooking liquid. Place spinach mixture in a blender or food processor; blend until very smooth, adding a tablespoon or two of the cooking liquid if needed.
Combine remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, and next 4 ingredients (through 3 chiles) in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook 2 minutes or until cumin turns golden brown, stirring frequently.
Stir in ginger and 1/4 teaspoon asafetida, if desired; cook 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Remove cloves and cardamom pods with a slotted spoon; discard. Stir in spinach mixture; swirl 1/4 cup cooking liquid in blender to extract puree clinging to the sides, and add to pan. Stir in salt. Reduce heat to medium; cook 5 minutes.
Place tofu on top of spinach mixture; cover and cook 5 minutes.
Combine ghee or oil with 3/4 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, and 3 chiles in a small skillet over medium-high heat; cook 2 minutes or until seeds turn golden brown, stirring frequently. Add 1/8 teaspoon asafetida, if desired, and ground red pepper. Carefully add 1 teaspoon water to keep ground red pepper from burning, and immediately pour oil mixture into spinach mixture. Stir.
