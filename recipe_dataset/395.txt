Pork Vindaloo
2  (3 1/2-ounce) bags boil-in-bag brown rice
2 teaspoons canola oil
1  (8-ounce) container prechopped onion
1  (1-pound) pork tenderloin, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
1¼ teaspoons garam masala
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
2 teaspoons bottled ground fresh ginger (such as Spice World)
¼  to 1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper
¼ cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1  (14.5-ounce) can petite diced tomatoes, undrained
1  (8-ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
Prepare rice according to package directions, omitting salt and fat; set aside.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion to pan; sauté 2 minutes. Combine pork and next 5 ingredients (through red pepper); toss well. Add pork mixture to pan; sauté for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.
Add broth to pan, scraping bottom of pan to loosen browned bits. Add tomatoes and tomato sauce; cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; stir in cilantro and vinegar. Serve over rice.
