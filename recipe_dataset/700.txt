Chicken Chilaquiles
12  (6-inch) corn tortillas, each cut into 8 wedges
1½ cups salsa verde (such as Herdez)
¾ cup chopped green onions
½ cup fat-free sour cream
Cooking spray
2 cups shredded skinless, boneless rotisserie chicken breast
1 cup (4 ounces) preshredded Mexican blend cheese

Combine salsa, green onions, and 1/2 cup sour cream, stirring with a whisk. Place half of the tortilla wedges in an 11 x 7-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Top evenly with 1 cup of chicken, about 1 cup of salsa mixture, and 1/2 cup of cheese. Repeat layers with the remaining tortilla wedges, 1 cup chicken, 1 cup salsa mixture, and 1/2 cup cheese (dish will be very full). Cover with foil coated with cooking spray. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350°.
