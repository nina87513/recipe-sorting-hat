1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger
4  garlic cloves, minced
3 cups chopped broccoli
1½ cups vertically sliced onion
1  (1-pound) flank steak, trimmed and cut across the grain into long, thin strips

2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon chile paste with garlic

While pasta cooks, heat peanut oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and garlic; sauté 30 seconds. Add broccoli and onion; sauté 3 minutes. Add steak, and sauté 5 minutes or until done. Add pasta mixture, soy sauce, and remaining ingredients; cook 1 minute or until lo mein is thoroughly heated, stirring constantly.
