Greens with Chèvre and Berries
 cup dried cranberries
2 tablespoons chopped dried apricots
6 tablespoons rice vinegar
¼ cup basil-flavor or plain extra-virgin olive oil
4  quarts salad mix (about 12 oz.), rinsed and crisped
4 ounces fresh chèvre (goat) cheese, coarsely crumbled
1 cup blueberries, rinsed and drained
Salt and pepper
In a 2-cup glass measure or small microwave-safe bowl, combine 2 tablespoons cranberries, apricots, and vinegar. Heat in a microwave oven at full power (100%) until steaming, about 1 minute. Let stand at room temperature or chill until cool.
In a blender or food processor, whirl fruit mixture until smooth. Pour purée back into glass measure; add oil and whisk to blend.
Put greens in a wide, shallow bowl. Add 2/3 of the vinaigrette and mix gently to coat. Scatter cheese, blueberries, and remaining cranberries evenly over greens. Drizzle with remaining vinaigrette. Add salt and pepper to taste.
