 cup cider vinegar
¼ cup water
1 teaspoon sugar
½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
½  jalapeño pepper, thinly sliced
Cooking spray
1 pound 90% lean ground sirloin
1½ teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon minced garlic
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
1½ teaspoons olive oil

Combine onion, vinegar, 1/4 cup water, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and jalapeño slices in a saucepan over high heat; bring to a simmer. Cook 1 minute; remove from heat, and let stand until ready to serve.
