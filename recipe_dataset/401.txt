Pork Vindaloo with Raita
Raita:
1½ cups plain low-fat yogurt
¾ cup chopped seeded peeled cucumber
¾ cup chopped seeded tomato
¼ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garam masala
Vindaloo:
1½ cups thinly sliced sweet onion
2 teaspoons grated peeled fresh ginger
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon ground cumin
¾ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground coriander
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
½ teaspoon black pepper
½  to 1 teaspoon ground red pepper
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2  garlic cloves, minced
1½ pounds boneless pork loin, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
Cooking spray
1 cup chopped seeded tomato
4½ cups hot cooked basmati rice
To prepare raita, spoon yogurt onto several layers of heavy-duty paper towels; spread to 1/2-inch thickness. Cover with additional paper towels; let stand 5 minutes. Scrape into a bowl using a rubber spatula. Stir in cucumber, 3/4 cup tomato, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and garam masala; cover and refrigerate.
To prepare vindaloo, combine onion and next 13 ingredients (through pork) in a large bowl; marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes.
Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add pork mixture; sauté 7 minutes or until lightly browned. Stir in 1 cup tomato. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes or until pork is tender, stirring occasionally. Serve with raita and rice.
