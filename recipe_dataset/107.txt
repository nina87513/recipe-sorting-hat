Shrimp Won Tons with Shiitake Mushroom-Miso Soup
Broth:
6 cups boiling water
1  green tea bag or 1 teaspoon loose green tea
3 tablespoons red miso (soybean paste) or tahini
1 cup thinly sliced shiitake mushroom caps (about 3 ounces mushrooms)
Filling:
 cup minced green onions
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
2 teaspoons dark sesame oil
2 teaspoons grated peeled fresh ginger
.13 teaspoon white pepper
½ pound large shrimp, peeled and finely chopped
¼ pound lean ground pork
2  garlic cloves, minced
20  won ton wrappers or gyoza skins
¼ cup (1-inch) thinly sliced red bell pepper
2 tablespoons (1-inch) sliced green onions
To prepare broth, pour boiling water over tea bag in a large saucepan; steep 5 minutes. Remove and reserve tea bag. Bring tea mixture to a boil. Add miso, stirring with a whisk until blended. Add mushrooms; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes. Remove from heat; cover and set aside.
To prepare filling, cut open reserved tea bag, and pour out loose tea; chop, if needed. Combine loose tea, minced onions, and next 8 ingredients (minced onions through garlic) in a medium bowl. Working with 1 won ton wrapper at a time (cover remaining wrappers with a damp towel to keep them from drying), spoon 1 tablespoon shrimp mixture on half of each wrapper. Moisten edges of wrapper with water; bring 2 opposite corners together. Pinch edges together to seal, forming a triangle.
Bring reserved tea mixture to a boil; add won tons, gently stir, and cook 4 minutes or until won tons float to the top. Ladle 5 won tons and 1 cup broth into each of 4 bowls. Divide bell pepper and onion slices evenly among bowls. Serve immediately.
Note: Ground turkey may be substituted for the ground pork.
