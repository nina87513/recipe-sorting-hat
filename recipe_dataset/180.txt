Scallops Provençale
1½ pounds large sea scallops (12 scallops), cut in half horizontally
2 teaspoons olive oil
 cup minced shallots or onion
1 cups sliced mushrooms
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons tomato paste
1  (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1½ teaspoons minced fresh or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
¼ cup minced fresh basil or parsley
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
Pat scallops dry with paper towels. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add scallops to pan, and cook 3 minutes on each side or until browned. Remove from pan, set aside, and keep warm.
Reduce heat to medium; add shallots, mushrooms, salt, and pepper to pan, and sauté 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and tomato paste; cook 1 minute, stirring often. Add tomatoes and thyme. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 6 minutes, stirring often.
Return scallops to pan, and cook 2 to 3 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Stir in basil and lemon juice.
