2 cups chopped onion
3  garlic cloves, minced
1½ cups water
¼ cup raisins
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1  (14.5-ounce) can no salt-added stewed tomatoes, undrained
1  (14-ounce) can low-salt beef broth
1  (14-ounce) can fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth

2  (15.5-ounce) cans golden hominy, drained
1¼ cups shredded Boston lettuce

Remove 1 large chile and 2 tablespoons adobo sauce from can; reserve remaining chiles and sauce for another use. Remove seeds from chile; finely chop. Stir chile and adobo sauce into pork mixture. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours or until pork is tender. Remove pork from pan using a slotted spoon; place pork in a large bowl. Shred pork using 2 forks. Add tomato mixture to pork in bowl. Let cool to room temperature; cover and chill overnight.
Skim solidified fat from surface of stew. Combine the stew, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and hominy in a large Dutch oven, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat; simmer 5 minutes. Ladle 1 cup stew into each of 10 bowls; top each with about 2 tablespoons of lettuce, about 1 tablespoon of chips, about 1 tablespoon of cilantro, and about 1 tablespoon of radishes.
