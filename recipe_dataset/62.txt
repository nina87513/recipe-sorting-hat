Chinese Hot-and-Sour Soup
2 pounds pork top loin, cut crosswise into 1/8-in.-thick strips
¼ cup plus 2 tbsp. soy sauce
2 tablespoons grated peeled fresh ginger
¾ cup rice vinegar
¼ cup cornstarch
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
¼ cup peanut oil
1  can (8 oz.) sliced bamboo shoots, drained and rinsed
12 cups chicken broth
¾ pound shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced
12 ounces firm tofu, drained and cubed
4  large eggs
½ teaspoon toasted sesame oil
About 1 tbsp. freshly ground black pepper (see Notes)
Chopped fresh cilantro and sliced green onions (pale green and white parts)
In a bowl, toss pork with 1/4 cup soy sauce and ginger. Marinate 20 minutes. In another bowl, stir together remaining 2 tbsp. soy sauce, rice vinegar, cornstarch, sugar, and salt; set aside.
Heat peanut oil in a large pot (at least 5 qts.) over medium-high heat, then add pork and marinade. Cook, stirring constantly, until pork loses its pink color, about 4 minutes. Stir in bamboo shoots and cook 1 minute.
Increase heat to high, add broth, and bring to a boil. Add mushrooms, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook about 20 minutes. Add tofu and simmer 5 minutes. Add soy-vinegar mixture and simmer 5 minutes more; the liquid will thicken.
In a small bowl, beat eggs with sesame oil. Slowly pour eggs into soup in a thin stream while stirring soup very slowly in one direction. Add pepper, stir briefly, then simmer 5 minutes. Serve with cilantro and green onions.
