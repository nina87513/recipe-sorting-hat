Chicken Cordon Bleu
¼ cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
5 teaspoons butter, melted
1  large garlic clove, minced
½ cup dry breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon grated fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1 teaspoon paprika
4  (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4  thin slices prosciutto (about 2 ounces)
¼ cup (1 ounce) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
Cooking spray
Preheat oven to 350°.
Place broth in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave at high 15 seconds or until warm. Stir in butter and garlic. Combine breadcrumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and paprika in a medium shallow bowl; set aside.
Place each chicken breast half between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap, and pound each to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin. Sprinkle both sides of chicken with salt, oregano, and pepper. Top each breast half with 1 slice of prosciutto and 1 tablespoon mozzarella. Roll up each breast half jelly-roll fashion. Dip each roll in chicken broth mixture; dredge in breadcrumb mixture. Place rolls, seam side down, in an 8-inch square baking dish coated with cooking spray. Pour remaining broth mixture over chicken. Bake at 350° for 28 minutes or until juices run clear and tops are golden.
