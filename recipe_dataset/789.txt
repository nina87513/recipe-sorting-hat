Beef and Bean Taco Salad
¾ pound extra-lean ground beef (93% lean)
¾ cup medium refrigerated fresh salsa (such as La Mexicana)
1  (15-ounce) can unsalted black beans, rinsed and drained
Cooking spray
4  (8-inch) 100% whole-wheat soft taco flour tortillas (such as Mission)
1 cup chopped tomato
¾ cup chopped ripe avocado
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 teaspoons fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon olive oil
¼ cup fat-free sour cream
2 teaspoons adobo sauce (from canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce)
1  (8-ounce) package presliced iceberg lettuce
1½ ounces preshredded reduced-fat Mexican blend cheese (1/3 cup)
Preheat broiler to high.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef to pan; sauté 5 minutes or until browned, stirring to crumble. Add salsa and beans; cook 5 minutes or until liquid almost evaporates.
Place 4 (7-ounce) ramekins upside down on a large jelly-roll pan; coat ramekins with cooking spray. Place 1 tortilla over each ramekin; fold down sides to form upside-down cups. Lightly coat tortillas with cooking spray. Broil 2 to 3 minutes on middle oven rack or until tortillas brown in spots. Remove pan from oven; let stand 1 minute. Invert tortillas, propping against ramekins and sides of pan to keep their shape; lightly coat with cooking spray. Broil an additional 2 minutes on middle rack or until browned. Remove from heat; cool slightly.
Place tomato, avocado, cilantro, lime juice, and oil in a small bowl; toss gently to combine. Combine sour cream and adobo sauce in a small bowl, stirring well.
Divide lettuce evenly among tortilla bowls. Top evenly with beef mixture; sprinkle evenly with cheese. Divide avocado mixture evenly over top; dollop 1 tablespoon sour cream mixture over each serving.
