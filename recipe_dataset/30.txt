Creole Seafood Jambalaya
½ pound bacon, diced
1 pound fresh pork sausage, casings removed
½ pound andouille sausage, diced
3 tablespoons lard
4  skinned and boned chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1  large onion, diced
1  bell pepper, diced
3  celery ribs, diced
3  garlic cloves, minced
2 cups converted white rice
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2  bay leaves
1½ tablespoons pimentón de la Vera or smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground red pepper
1 tablespoon celery salt
1 cup canned crushed tomatoes
2 cups basic chicken stock
1½ pounds raw Louisiana white shrimp or other wild American shrimp, peeled and deveined
1  bunch green onions, chopped
Heat a large Dutch oven over high heat until hot, and then reduce heat to medium. (This will allow the heat to be uniform all over, preventing those little hot spots that are likely to burn.) Cook bacon, sausages, and lard in the hot pot, stirring slowly with a long wooden spoon, for 10 minutes. Season chicken thighs with kosher salt and black pepper. Add the chicken to pot, and cook, stirring often, 5 minutes or until chicken is brown.
Increase heat to medium-high. Add onion to pot, and cook about 15 minutes or until soft. Add bell pepper, celery, and garlic, and cook 5 minutes. Continue stirring occasionally so everything in the pot cooks evenly.
Add rice, thyme, bay leaves, pimentón, red pepper, and celery salt to pot, and cook, stirring often, 3 minutes. Increase heat to high, and add tomatoes and chicken stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover pot, and simmer 15 minutes.
After the rice has simmered for 15 minutes, fold in the shrimp and green onions. Turn off the heat, and let everything continue to cook in the hot covered pot 10 more minutes. Remove the lid, fluff the jambalaya, and serve.
