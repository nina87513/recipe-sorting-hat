Spread about 1/3 cup hummus over each tortilla, leaving a 1/2-inch border around edges. Top each with 1/2 cup spinach and kale blend, one-fourth of bell pepper, 3 tablespoons goat cheese, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Roll up wraps. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add wraps; cook 1 1/2 minutes on each side or until lightly browned.
