Chicken Fajita Burritos with Feta Crema
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon cumin
1 pound boned, skinned chicken breast halves (2 to 3), cut into 1-in. chunks
½ cup sour cream
½  jalapeño chile, seeded and minced
½ cup crumbled feta cheese (about 3 oz.)
1 tablespoon lime juice, plus wedges of 1 lime
3 tablespoons olive oil
3  Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1  bunch (about 4) spring onions (with fat bulbs) or regular green onions, thinly sliced
4  flour tortillas (about 10 in.), warmed
2 cups finely shredded cabbage
½ cup chopped cilantro
Whisk together seasonings in a medium bowl. Add chicken and turn to coat.
Stir sour cream, jalapeño, feta, and lime juice in a small bowl to make feta crema.
Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large frying pan and cook chicken until browned and cooked through, turning pieces occasionally, about 7 minutes. Add tomatoes and onions to pan with a squeeze of lime and stir to blend.
Divide chicken mixture among tortillas, top with cabbage and cilantro, then feta crema. Wrap up burrito-style and serve with more lime wedges.
