Summer Chickpea Ragout
1 cup bulgur wheat
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1  small onion, chopped
2  small carrots, diced
4 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
1  can (15 oz.) chickpeas (garbanzos), rinsed and drained
1 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels
1  small red bell pepper, cut into 1-in. chunks
1  small yellow bell pepper, cut into 1-in. chunks
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
2  to 3 small zucchini (about 8 oz. total), trimmed and sliced into 1/4-in.-thick rounds
1  to 2 small yellow squash (about 4 oz. total), trimmed and cut into 1/4-in.-thick rounds
2 tablespoons lemon juice
½ cup finely sliced fresh basil leaves, divided
Olive oil
Cook bulgur according to package instructions.
Heat extra-virgin olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent but not browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Add carrots and cook until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in broth, chickpeas, corn, bell peppers, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Boil 2 minutes to reduce by about a third.
Reduce heat, add zucchini and yellow squash, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until zucchini and squash are tender but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Add lemon juice and 1/4 cup basil.
Divide bulgur among 4 bowls, top with vegetables, sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup basil, and drizzle with olive oil.
