Sweet and Sour Turkey Meatballs with Polenta
3 cups unsalted chicken stock (such as Swanson)
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¾ cup stone-ground polenta
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1¼ pounds 93% lean ground turkey
2 tablespoons dark sesame oil
Cooking spray
¼ cup water
¼ cup unsalted ketchup
2 tablespoons Sriracha (hot chile sauce)
1½ tablespoons oyster sauce
1½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
Bring stock and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Gradually add polenta, stirring constantly with a whisk. Reduce heat, and simmer 25 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and polenta is thickened. Add butter, stirring until melted.
Combine turkey and sesame oil in a medium bowl. Divide and shape turkey mixture into 20 meatballs. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add meatballs to pan; cook 6 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. Remove meatballs from pan. Add 1/4 cup water and remaining ingredients to pan, stirring with a whisk; bring to a boil. Return meatballs to pan. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes or until meatballs are done. Serve over polenta.
