4 teaspoons chili garlic sauce, divided
5 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce, divided
1¼ pounds large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and finely chopped
40  gyoza skins or wonton wrappers

Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add oil; swirl to coat. Add garlic; cook 1 1/2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in carrot; cook 1 minute. Stir in cabbage; cook 3 minutes or until wilted. Stir in 1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce; cook 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat; stir in 2 tablespoons soy sauce. Cool; stir in shrimp.
Arrange 8 gyoza skins on a clean work surface. Spoon about 2 rounded teaspoons shrimp mixture in center of each skin. Moisten edges of skins with water. Fold in half; press edges together to seal. Place on a baking sheet sprinkled with cornstarch; cover to prevent drying. Repeat with remaining gyoza skins and shrimp mixture. Set aside, or follow freezing instructions.
Bring remaining chili garlic sauce, remaining soy sauce, 1 tablespoon water, honey, and vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan. Cook 3 minutes or until thickened, stirring frequently.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Coat both sides of potstickers with cooking spray. Arrange 10 potstickers in skillet; cook 2 minutes or until browned. Turn potstickers over.

Repeat with remaining potstickers and water. Serve with soy sauce mixture.
