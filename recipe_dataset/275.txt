Three-Bean Cassoulet with Cornmeal Dumplings
CASSOULET
1 cup sliced carrots
½ cup coarsely chopped red onion
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1  (8-oz.) package cooked cubed ham
1  (16-oz.) package frozen baby lima beans
1  (16-oz.) package frozen butter peas
1 cup frozen black-eyed peas
1  (32-oz.) container reduced-sodium chicken broth
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
½ teaspoon table salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
CORNMEAL DUMPLINGS
½ cup all-purpose flour
½ cup plain yellow cornmeal
1 teaspoon baking powder
¼ teaspoon baking soda
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons cold butter, cubed
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
 cup buttermilk
Prepare Cassoulet: Sauté carrots and onion in hot oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat 3 to 4 minutes or until tender. Add garlic, and sauté 1 minute. Add ham, and cook, stirring often, 3 minutes. Stir in lima beans and next 6 ingredients; bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare Dumplings: Whisk together flour and next 5 ingredients in a medium bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in rosemary; add buttermilk, and stir just until dough is moistened.
Drop dough by tablespoonfuls 1/2 to 1 inch apart into bean mixture. Cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes or until dumplings are done and dry to the touch. Serve immediately.
