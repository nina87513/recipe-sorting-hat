Yogurt-and-Curry-Marinated Chicken
1¾ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-in. cubes
2 tablespoons curry powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1  medium zucchini (about 10 oz.), cut into 1-in. cubes
1 cup grape tomatoes
Grapeseed oil
¼ cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, torn
6  lime wedges, for serving
Place chicken in a medium bowl and sprinkle with curry, salt and pepper. Stir in yogurt, lime juice and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 12 hours. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Thread chicken, zucchini and tomatoes alternately onto 12 (6-inch) wooden skewers.
Preheat grill to medium-high (about 450°F). Generously oil grill grate with grapeseed oil. Grill skewers until done, 4 to 5minutes per side. Transfer to a platter, drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with parsley. Serve with lime wedges.
