Paella with Soy Chorizo and Edamame
6 ounces meatless soy chorizo (such as Soyrizo)
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2¼ cups chopped yellow onion (about 1 large)
¼ teaspoon saffron threads, crushed
4  garlic cloves, minced
1 cup Valencia or other medium-grain rice
1 cup (1/2-inch) pieces red bell pepper
½ cup dry white wine
2 cups organic vegetable broth
¼ teaspoon salt
1½ cups frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans), thawed
¼ cup coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
¼ cup chopped green onions
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add soy chorizo to pan, and cook for 12 minutes or until browned, crumbling and stirring occasionally. Place in a small bowl, and set aside.
Return pan to medium heat. Add olive oil, swirling to coat. Add yellow onion; cover and cook for 10 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add saffron and garlic; cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add 1 cup rice and bell pepper; cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in white wine, and cook for 2 minutes or until liquid is nearly absorbed, stirring frequently. Add vegetable broth and salt; bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.
Return soy chorizo to pan, and stir in edamame. Cook for 5 minutes or until edamame is thoroughly heated, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and 1/4 cup green onions.
