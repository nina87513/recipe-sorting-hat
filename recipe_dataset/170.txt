Good Morning Crepes
8  slices turkey bacon
Cooking spray
6  large eggs and 6 large egg whites, beaten
Â¼ teaspoon black pepper
4  premade crepes or 10-inch whole-wheat wraps
4 tablespoons maple syrup, divided
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; cook the turkey bacon until crisp (about 4-6 minutes), turning occasionally. Remove the turkey bacon from pan; set aside. Coat pan with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. Add eggs and black pepper to pan; scramble until desired degree of doneness (about 2-3 minutes), stirring well.
Arrange 2 slices turkey bacon on a premade crepe. Top with 1/4 of the scrambled eggs (about 3/4 cup). Roll up or fold each crepe; drizzle each crepe with 1 tablespoon maple syrup. Serve hot.
