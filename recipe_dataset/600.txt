Cheesy Chicken Enchiladas
2½ cups chopped cooked chicken breast
2 cups (8 ounces) preshredded reduced-fat 4-cheese Mexican blend cheese
1 cups plain low-fat yogurt
 cup butter, melted
¼ cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1  (10 3/4-ounce) can condensed reduced-fat, reduced-sodium cream of chicken soup (such as Healthy Request), undiluted
1  (4.5-ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained
8  (8-inch) flour tortillas
1 tablespoon canola oil
Cooking spray
½ cup (2 ounces) finely shredded reduced-fat sharp cheddar cheese
¼ cup chopped green onions
Preheat oven to 350°.
Combine first 9 ingredients in a large bowl. Remove 1 cup chicken mixture; set mixture aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working with 1 tortilla at a time, brush oil over both sides of tortilla. Add tortilla to pan; cook 5 seconds on each side or until toasted and soft. Remove from pan; arrange 1/2 cup chicken mixture down center of tortilla. Roll jelly-roll style; place filled tortilla, seam side down, in a 13 x 9inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Repeat procedure with remaining 7 tortillas, remaining oil, and remaining chicken mixture. Spread reserved 1 cup chicken mixture evenly over enchiladas. Cover and bake at 350° for 20 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle evenly with cheddar cheese and green onions; bake an additional 5 minutes or until cheese melts.
Wine note: Just as a crunchy green salad with mango will complement Cheesy Chicken Enchiladas, so too will a crisp, tropical fruit-filled California chardonnay, like Kali Hart Vineyard Chardonnay 2007 ($17). With its medium body and lively acidity, this white wine slices through creamy dairy products, like cheese and yogurt. A shot of citrus flavor and a nice bit of lingering sweetness also give it the ability to balance spicy chiles. Jeffery Lindenmuth
