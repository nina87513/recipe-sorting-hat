Italian Ravioli Casserole
2  (9-ounce) packages fresh reduced-fat cheese ravioli
1  (6-ounce) package fresh spinach (about 6 cups)
1  (26-ounce) bottle tomato-basil pasta sauce (such as Classico)
½ teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 cup (4 ounces) shredded Asiago cheese, divided
¼ cup thinly sliced fresh basil
Preheat oven to 375°.
Cook ravioli in boiling water 3 minutes, omitting salt and fat. Stir in spinach until wilted. Drain.
Combine pasta sauce and pepper. Spoon 1 1/2 cups sauce mixture in the bottom of an 11 x 7-inch baking dish. Spoon half of the ravioli mixture over sauce. Top with 1/2 cup cheese. Spoon remaining ravioli mixture over cheese. Top with remaining sauce. Cover with foil; bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil; sprinkle with 1/2 cup cheese. Bake, uncovered, for an additional 5 minutes or until cheese melts. Garnish with basil.
