Quick Shrimp and Chorizo Paella
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound chorizo, sliced
1  large onion, diced
2  cloves garlic, minced
1  1-oz. packet vegetable soup mix
½ teaspoon paprika
2 cups long-grain rice
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1  14-oz. can diced tomatoes, drained
1 cup frozen peas
1 pound previously cooked frozen shrimp (not thawed)
Pepper
Preheat oven to 400°F. Warm oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chorizo and sauté until it starts to brown, 5 minutes. Add onion and garlic; sauté for 2 minutes. Stir in soup mix, paprika and rice; stir well to coat rice in soup mix. Cook for about 1 minute.
Pour in broth and bring to a boil. Stir in tomatoes. Bring mixture to a simmer, then cover pot with a tightfitting lid.
Transfer to oven and bake for 15 minutes. Add peas and shrimp; cook for 5 minutes more. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before removing lid. Fluff rice with a fork and season with pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
