Crawfish Etouffee
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ cup vegetable oil
1 cup (4 oz.) all-purpose flour
1  poblano chile, seeds removed, diced
3  celery stalks, diced
1  medium-size yellow onion, diced
3  garlic cloves, chopped
1  jalapeno chile, seeds removed (if desired), diced
2 cups seafood stock
2 pounds frozen peeled crawfish tails, thawed and rinsed
¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
8 cups cooked white long-grain rice
½ cup sliced scallions, white and light green parts only
2 teaspoons hot sauce, plus more for serving
Stir together the first five ingredients in a small bowl.
Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high. Add flour, and stir well to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring, until roux is the color of caramel sauce, about 20 minutes. Add poblano, celery, and onion. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add garlic, jalapeño, and paprika mixture. Cook 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in stock. Return to a simmer over medium-high. Stir in crawfish, parsley, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Cook until warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve with hot rice, scallions, and hot sauce.
