Chicken Roulade with Herbed Cheese and Prosciutto
4  (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons light garlic and herb spreadable cheese (such as Alouette Light)
2 ounces prosciutto, chopped
16  large spinach leaves, stemmed
8 ounces uncooked fettuccine
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
¼ teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons extravirgin olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons white wine
2 tablespoons water
Place each chicken breast half between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap; pound each piece to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat mallet or small heavy skillet. Sprinkle both sides of chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper.
Combine cheese and prosciutto in a small bowl. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoons cheese mixture over each breast half. Place 4 spinach leaves on each breast half; flatten with hand. Roll up chicken, jelly-roll fashion, starting with narrow end. Secure at 1-inch intervals with twine. Set aside.
Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt and fat. Drain well. Place pasta in a large bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons oil; toss gently to coat. Cover and keep warm.
Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in pan, and cook for 6 minutes, browning on all sides. Add wine and water. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 6 minutes or until chicken is done. Remove chicken from pan, and let stand for 2 minutes. Remove twine, and slice each roulade crosswise into 5 equal pieces.
Place about 1 cup of the pasta mixture on each of 4 plates; top each with 5 pieces roulade. Serve immediately.
