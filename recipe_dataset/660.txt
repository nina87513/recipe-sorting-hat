Mexican Tortilla Soup
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
12 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast, trimmed and diced
1 cup prechopped onion (find at the salad bar)
1 cup prechopped green bell pepper (find at the salad bar)
2  garlic cloves, minced (1 teaspoon)
¾ teaspoon ground cumin
¾ teaspoon chili powder
2  (14-ounce) cans fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1  (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
 cup chopped fresh cilantro
½ cup coarsely crushed baked tortilla chips (such as Tostitos)
½ cup preshredded reduced-fat Mexican blend cheese
6  lime wedges (about 1 1/2 limes)
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a nonstick Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, and cook, stirring often, 3-4 minutes or until browned. Remove to plate, and cover.
In the same pan, heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil on medium-high. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, 5 minutes or until softened. Stir in cumin, chili powder, broth, and tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes.
Return the chicken and juices to the pan and simmer 3 minutes or until heated through. Stir in cilantro.
Ladle soup into serving bowls; top with crushed tortilla chips and cheese. Serve hot, with a lime wedge on the side.
Andrea's wine pick: You can't go wrong with a tangy, herbaceous New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc to match the lively cilantro and lime flavors in the soup. Look for Drylands Sauvignon Blanc, Marlborough 2006 ($15).
