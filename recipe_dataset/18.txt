Jane's Famous Dilled Potato Salad
4½ pounds Yukon Gold or other thin-skinned white potatoes (each about 2 1/2 in. wide), scrubbed
2½ cups chopped celery
1 cup mayonnaise
 cup cider vinegar
½ cup finely chopped red onion
 cup sweet pickle relish
3  hard-cooked large eggs, shelled and chopped
 cup chopped parsley
 cup chopped fresh dill
Salt and pepper
Fresh dill sprigs
In a 6- to 8-quart pan, combine potatoes and 4 quarts water. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender when pierced, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain and let stand until cool enough to touch, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix celery, mayonnaise, vinegar, onion, and pickle relish. Peel warm potatoes, cut into 1-inch chunks, and add to dressing; mix gently. Let stand at room temperature or chill until cool.
Add eggs, parsley, and chopped dill; mix gently and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and chill until cold, at least 2 hours. Garnish with dill sprigs.
