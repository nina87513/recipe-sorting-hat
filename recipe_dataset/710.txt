Cheese Quesadillas
Â½ cup shredded jack cheese
5  or 6 flour tortillas (8 in. wide)
Spread about cheese over half of each tortilla; fold bare halves over cheese. Grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds), turning once, for 2 minutes total. Cut into wedges.
