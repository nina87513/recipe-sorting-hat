12 ounces baby red potatoes
¼ cup olive oil
2½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
½ teaspoon kosher salt
8 ounces canned albacore tuna in water, drained
6  kalamata olives, sliced
5  cornichon pickles, chopped
1  large shallot, chopped
10 ounce leftover Green Beans with Dried Cranberries and Hazelnuts

Place potatoes in a medium saucepan; cover with cool water to 2 inches above potatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 12 minutes or until tender. Drain; cool. Cut potatoes in half; place in a medium bowl.
Combine oil, lemon juice, parsley, tarragon, and salt in a medium bowl, stirring with a whisk. Drizzle 3 tablespoons dressing over potatoes; toss to coat. Add tuna, olives, pickles, and shallot to bowl with remaining dressing; toss gently to coat.
Arrange about 3/4 cup Green Beans with Dried Cranberries and Hazelnuts, 1/2 cup potatoes, and 1/2 cup tuna mixture on each of 4 plates. Divide eggs evenly among servings; sprinkle eggs with pepper.
