Pad Thai
8 ounces rice noodles
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons sugar
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper (or to desired hotness)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1  egg, lightly beaten
¾ pound frozen uncooked shrimp
4  garlic cloves, minced
4  coarsely chopped green onions
2 cups fresh bean sprouts (optional)
¼ cup coarsely chopped, unsalted, dry-roasted peanuts, for garnish
Lime wedges, for garnish
Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Remove from heat, and add the rice noodles, stirring to separate. Soak 5-7 minutes or until tender; then drain the noodles and rinse in cold water. Set aside.
Mix fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and crushed red pepper in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add egg and cook quickly, until opaque. Move to side. Add frozen shrimp to skillet, and cook 5-7 minutes or until just cooked through. Drain excess liquid. Add garlic, and stir-fry 1 minute.
Add remaining oil and then noodles. Stir-fry noodles quickly until softened, about 2 minutes. Add sauce mixture. Coat the noodles evenly, stirring until heated through. Stir in green onions and bean sprouts, if desired, and cook 2 more minutes. Mound on serving platter, and garnish with peanuts, lime wedges, and cilantro.
