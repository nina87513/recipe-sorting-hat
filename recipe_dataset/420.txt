Garbanzos Masala
1  onion (about 8 oz.), peeled and chopped
2  fresh jalapeño chilies (2 to 3 oz. total), rinsed, stemmed, seeded, and chopped
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 tablespoon salad oil
½ cup finely chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon curry powder
1½  teaspoons garam masala
½ teaspoon sugar
1  can (15 to 16 oz.) garbanzos, drained
2  to 3 firm-ripe tomatoes (1 lb. total), rinsed, cored, and chopped (including juice)
About 1 cup plain yogurt
Salt
In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, combine onion, chilies, ginger, and oil; stir often until onion is lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, curry powder, garam masala, and sugar; stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in garbanzos and all but 1/2 cup of the tomatoes, then add 1/2 cup water. Boil over medium-high heat, stirring often, until tomatoes have disintegrated and most of the liquid has boiled away, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in 1 cup yogurt, and season to taste with salt.
Pour into a bowl; top with remaining chopped cilantro, chopped tomatoes, and more yogurt to taste.
