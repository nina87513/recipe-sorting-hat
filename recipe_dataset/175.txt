Quick Cassoulet
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  (4-inch) pork sausages, sliced (about 8 ounces)
4  (4-inch) lamb sausages, sliced (about 6 1/2 ounces)
4  (4-inch) duck sausages, sliced (about 8 1/2 ounces)
Cooking spray
1 cup finely chopped onion
½ cup finely chopped carrot
½ cup finely chopped celery
2 tablespoons minced garlic
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon salt
½ cup dry white wine
¼ cup cognac or brandy
5  thyme sprigs
2  bay leaves
2  whole cloves
1 cup fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
3  (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
1  (14.5-ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes, drained
1  (4-ounce) piece French bread baguette
1½ tablespoons unsalted butter
Preheat oven to 325°.
Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add sausages; cook 6 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove sausages from pan using a slotted spoon; drain. Wipe pan with paper towels, leaving browned bits on bottom of pan. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add onion and next 5 ingredients (through salt); cook 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add wine and cognac; bring to a boil. Cook 10 minutes or until liquid almost evaporates, scraping pan to loosen browned bits.
Place thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and cloves on a double layer of cheesecloth. Gather edges of cheesecloth together; tie securely. Add cheesecloth bag, broth, beans, and tomatoes to vegetable mixture; stir to combine. Return sausages to pan; stir. Bring mixture to a boil, and remove from heat.
Place bread in a food processor; pulse 10 times or until fine crumbs measure 2 cups. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add crumbs to pan; sauté 5 minutes or until golden, stirring frequently. Sprinkle crumbs evenly over bean mixture. Bake at 325° for 40 minutes. Discard cheesecloth bag before serving.
