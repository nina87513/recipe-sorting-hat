3 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons grated peeled ginger

½ cup cornstarch
2½ tablespoons dark sesame oil, divided
1 cup vertically sliced red onion
2 tablespoons chopped roasted, unsalted peanuts

Add half of tofu to pan; cook 5 minutes or until browned on all sides. Remove cooked tofu from pan. Repeat procedure with remaining tofu and 1 tablespoon oil. Add remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil and onion to pan; cook 4 minutes. Return tofu to pan; cook 1 minute.
