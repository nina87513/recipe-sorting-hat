Vanilla Bean-Espresso Crème Brûlée
2 cups heavy whipping cream
2 cups whole milk
 cup granulated sugar
4 teaspoons espresso powder
1  vanilla bean, split lengthwise
10  large egg yolks
½ cup granulated sugar or brown sugar
Preheat oven to 350°. Combine first 5 ingredients in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, 10 minutes or until sugar dissolves and mixture begins to simmer. Let cool 5 minutes. Remove vanilla bean and discard. Whisk together egg yolks in a large bowl. Gradually whisk one-fourth hot cream mixture into yolks. Whisk yolk mixture into hot mixture. Pour custard evenly into 8 lightly greased (6- to 7-ounce) ramekins or custard cups. Place in a large baking dish or roasting pan; add hot water to a depth of 1 inch. Bake 35 minutes or until set. Remove ramekins from water, and cool slightly on a wire rack. Cover and chill at least 8 hours. Sprinkle 3 teaspoons sugar evenly over each custard. Melt sugar with a kitchen torch until caramelized. Serve immediately.
