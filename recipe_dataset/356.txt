2  medium onions, cut into wedges
5  garlic cloves
2 teaspoons ground cumin, divided
1½ teaspoons ground red pepper, divided
1  (2-inch) piece peeled fresh ginger, sliced
½ cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
6  skinless, boneless chicken thighs (1 3/4 pounds)
¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
Cooking spray
3 tablespoons canola oil
1  (2-inch) cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon ground coriander
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
1½ cups crushed tomatoes
¾ cup half-and-half
¼ cup milk
2 tablespoons cilantro leaves
Preheat oven to 375°. Place onion and garlic in a food processor; process until a smooth paste forms. Spoon half of paste into a small bowl; cover and chill. Add 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon red pepper, and ginger to remaining paste in food processor; process until smooth. Stir in yogurt and lemon juice.
Combine chicken and yogurt mixture in a large zip-top plastic bag; seal and marinate in refrigerator 2 hours.
Remove chicken from bag; discard marinade. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt evenly over both sides of chicken. Place chicken on a rack coated with cooking spray; place rack in a foil-lined pan. Bake at 375° for 16 minutes or until done, turning after 8 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes; cut chicken into bite-sized pieces.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add cinnamon stick; cook 1 minute or until fragrant, stirring frequently. Stir in 1 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper, 1/4 teaspoon salt, coriander, and turmeric; cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low; stir in reserved onion-garlic paste. Cook 12 minutes or until lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Stir in tomatoes; bring to a simmer over medium heat, and cook 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in half-and-half and milk; bring to a simmer. Stir in chicken; simmer 2 minutes or until heated. Sprinkle with cilantro.
