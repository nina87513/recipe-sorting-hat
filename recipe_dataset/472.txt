Tuscan Steak Salad
1  large garlic clove
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
½ teaspoon grated lemon rind
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
1  (8-ounce) boneless strip steak
Cooking spray
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
3 cups Italian-blend salad greens
2 tablespoons shaved Parmesan cheese
Mince garlic on a cutting board. Sprinkle garlic with salt; mash with the side of a knife to form a paste. Combine garlic paste, 1 tablespoon oil, rosemary, rind, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Rub garlic mixture evenly over steak. Let stand 15 minutes.
Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add steak to pan; grill 5 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. Place steak on a cutting board; let stand 5 minutes. Cut across the grain into thin slices.
Combine remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper, vinegar, and Dijon mustard in a bowl, stirring with a whisk. Add greens; toss to coat. Place 1 1/2 cups salad on each of 2 plates; top each serving with 3 1/2 ounces steak and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.
