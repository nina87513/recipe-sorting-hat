Lentil Dal with Garlic-and-Cumin-Infused Oil
1¼ cups dried pink or yellow lentils
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
4 cups water
1 cup chopped plum tomato
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1½ teaspoons cumin seeds
4  garlic cloves, sliced
¼ teaspoon ground red pepper
 cup minced fresh cilantro, divided
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Place lentils and turmeric in a large saucepan; cover with 4 cups water. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add tomato; cook for 5 minutes or until lentils are tender. Stir in salt; keep warm.
Heat the vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds and garlic; cook 2 minutes or until garlic is golden, stirring constantly. Stir in the red pepper, and remove from heat. Pour oil mixture over lentils, and stir in 2 tablespoons cilantro. Spoon the dal into individual bowls, and sprinkle with the remaining cilantro and the lemon juice.
