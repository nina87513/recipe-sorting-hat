Smothered Chicken In Mushroom Ragoût
1 teaspoon olive oil
4  (4-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¼ teaspoon pepper
4 cups sliced cremini mushrooms (about 8 ounces)
4 cups thinly sliced shiitake mushroom caps (about 8 ounces)
2 cups chopped leek
 cup dry white wine
 cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon sherry
¼ teaspoon salt
1 cup reduced-fat sour cream
2 cups hot cooked medium egg noodles (about 3 ounces uncooked noodles)
Chopped fresh parsley (optional)
Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken evenly with pepper. Add chicken to pan, and cook 6 minutes on each side. Remove from pan, and keep warm.
Add mushrooms and leek to pan; sauté 8 minutes. Return chicken to pan. Add wine, broth, sherry, and salt; cook 2 minutes or until chicken is done. Remove from heat; stir in sour cream. Serve over noodles. Garnish with parsley, if desired.
