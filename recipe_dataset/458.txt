Italian-style Shrimp with Spaghetti
8 ounces dried spaghetti
½ cup finely chopped shallots (about 3 oz.)
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons olive oil
1  can (14 1/2 oz.) Italian-style diced tomatoes
1  can (6 oz.) tomato paste
½ cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 pound (40 to 50 per lb.) frozen shelled deveined shrimp, thawed
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
Salt and pepper
Shredded romano or parmesan cheese
In a 4- to 5-quart pan over high heat, bring 2 quarts water to a boil. Add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender to bite, about 10 minutes. Drain and return to pan.
Meanwhile, in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat, stir shallots and garlic in olive oil until shallots are limp, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes (with juice), tomato paste, wine, oregano, and basil. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
Rinse and drain shrimp; add to sauce. Stir often just until opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 5 to 6 minutes.
Stir sauce into cooked pasta. Divide mixture equally among four bowls. Sprinkle with parsley; add salt, pepper, and cheese to taste.
