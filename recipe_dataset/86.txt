1  large egg white, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
½ teaspoon garlic powder
.13 teaspoon ground ginger

Place a small skillet over medium-high heat until hot; add sesame seeds, and sauté for 5 to 7 minutes or until seeds are fragrant and golden. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Combine egg white, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ginger in a small bowl.
Cut won ton wrappers in half diagonally, three at a time. Place in a 15 x 10-inch jelly-roll pan coated with cooking spray. Brush egg white mixture over won tons, and sprinkle evenly with sesame seeds.
Bake on lowest oven rack at 375° for 6 to 7 minutes or until crisp and lightly browned. Remove from pan, and cool completely on wire racks.
