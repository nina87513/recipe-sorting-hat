Greek Stuffed Pitas
12  cooked meatballs (from Sheet Pan Swedish Meatballs)
¼ cup unsalted beef stock (such as Swanson)
 cup grated English cucumber
½ cup plain 2% reduced-fat Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons grated red onion
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided
1½ tablespoons chopped fresh dill
.38 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1  garlic clove, minced
2½ cups sliced red cabbage
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
4  (6-in.) whole-wheat pitas, halved
2  medium tomatoes, each cut into 8 slices
¼ cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
Combine meatballs and stock in a microwave-safe bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Microwave at HIGH 2 minutes or until meatballs are warm.
Wrap grated cucumber in a clean kitchen towel, squeezing out as much liquid as possible. Combine cucumber, yogurt, onion, 1 1/2 teaspoons juice, dill, 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper, and garlic in a bowl, stirring with a whisk. Combine remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons juice, remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt, cabbage, and oil in a bowl. Divide yogurt mixture among pita halves; top evenly with cabbage mixture, tomatoes, meatballs, and parsley leaves.
