Chinese Hot and Sour Soup
3 cups fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
1½ teaspoons chili garlic sauce (such as Lee Kum Kee)
1  (4-ounce) package gourmet blend mushrooms (baby bella, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms), sliced
½  (16-ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cubed
¼ cup drained sliced bamboo shoots, cut into julienne strips
¼ cup rice wine vinegar
¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
¼ cup water
1½ tablespoons cornstarch
1  large egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon sesame oil
Sliced green onions (optional)
Bring first 4 ingredients to a boil in a Dutch oven. Reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes. Add tofu and next 3 ingredients. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes.
Combine water and cornstarch in a small bowl; stir well with a whisk. Add cornstarch mixture to soup. Bring to a boil, and cook 1 minute or until soup begins to thicken. Reduce heat to medium.
Pour egg in a slow, steady stream into simmering soup. Stir in sesame oil. Garnish with green onions, if desired. Serve immediately.
