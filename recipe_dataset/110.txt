Stir-Fried Chicken with Vegetables and Lo Mein Noodles
¾ cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons bourbon or water
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
2 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce
½ teaspoon salt
1 pound skinned, boned chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips
10 ounce uncooked wide lo mein noodles or fettuccine
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided
1 cup small broccoli florets
½ cup diagonally sliced carrot
½ cup (1-inch) sliced green onions
1  (8-ounce) package cremini mushrooms, quartered
1  (8-ounce) package frozen sugar snap peas, thawed
Combine first 6 ingredients in a small bowl. Combine 1/4 cup broth mixture and chicken in a bowl. Reserve the remaining broth mixture.
Prepare noodles according to package directions, omitting salt; drain noodles, and keep warm.
Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet until hot. Add the chicken mixture, and stir-fry for 5 minutes or until done. Remove the chicken from pan, and keep warm. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in pan until hot. Add the broccoli and remaining ingredients, and stir-fry for 5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Return the chicken and reserved broth mixture to pan; cover and cook over medium heat for 2 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Serve over noodles.
