Quick Shrimp Pad Thai
8 ounces pad thai noodles, preferably A Taste of Thai or Thai Kitchen brands
2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce
3 tablespoons light brown sugar
¼ cup fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving
2  Thai bird chiles or 1 serrano with seeds, stemmed and thinly sliced
¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon canola oil
3  (1 cup) large shallots, thinly sliced
3  large garlic cloves, minced
12 ounces shelled and deveined medium shrimp
2  large eggs, beaten
4  scallions, thinly sliced
Roasted peanuts, chopped cilantro and bean sprouts, for serving
Put the noodles in a large bowl and cover with very hot water. Let soak until just pliable, about 5 minutes. Transfer the noodles to a colander and drain, shaking and tossing the noodles once or twice.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the fish sauce, brown sugar, lime juice and chiles.
In a large nonstick skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the oil until shimmering. Add the shallots and garlic and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the pad thai noodles and stir-fry until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to curl and turn pink, about 2 minutes. Scrape the noodles and shrimp to one side of the pan and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the empty side of the skillet. Add the eggs and cook, stirring occasionally, until nearly set, about 1 minute. Add the scallions and toss everything together, keeping the eggs relatively intact. Add the fish sauce mixture and stir-fry until the noodles are evenly coated, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the pad thai to a platter. Top with peanuts, cilantro and bean sprouts and serve with lime wedges.
