Tempura Green Beans with Mild Cayenne Sour Cream
4 cups canola oil
4.4 ounces gluten-free all-purpose flour (about 1 cup; such as Bob's Red Mill)
5 ounces white rice flour (about 1 cup; such as Bob's Red Mill)
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon black pepper
1¼ cups club soda, chilled
8 ounces green beans, trimmed
½ teaspoon kosher salt
Mild Cayenne Sour Cream
Preheat oven to 200°.
Clip a candy thermometer onto the side of a 4-quart Dutch oven; add oil to pan. Heat oil to 385°.
While oil heats, weigh or lightly spoon flours into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flours, paprika, baking soda, and black pepper in a medium bowl. Gradually add club soda, stirring with a whisk until smooth.
Dip beans, 1 at a time, in batter, coating completely. Add to hot oil in a single layer. (Do not crowd pan.) Fry, in batches, 1 minute or until golden, turning once. (Maintain temperature of oil at 375°.) Drain beans on a paper towellined jelly-roll pan. Place pan in oven, and keep warm at 200° until ready to serve. Sprinkle beans evenly with salt just before serving. Serve with Mild Cayenne Sour Cream.
