Tandoori Tofu and Vegetable Kebabs
1  (16-ounce) package water-packed firm tofu, drained and cut into 16 cubes
Cooking spray
1 cup finely chopped onion
¾ cup plain low-fat yogurt
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1½ teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons grated peeled fresh ginger
2 teaspoons canola oil
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1  garlic clove, minced
16  large mushrooms (about 10 ounces)
2  small red onions, each cut into 8 wedges
2 cups water
1 cups uncooked basmati rice
 cup golden raisins
1 teaspoon salt, divided
Preheat oven to 375°.
Arrange tofu in a single layer on a foil-lined baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Bake at 375° for 25 minutes or until tofu releases 3 or more tablespoons liquid.
Prepare grill.
Combine chopped onion and next 8 ingredients (through garlic) in a large bowl. Add tofu, mushrooms, and onion wedges; toss gently to coat. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.
While tofu and vegetables marinate, prepare rice. Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan; stir in rice. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Stir in raisins and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Let stand 5 minutes; fluff with a fork.
Remove tofu and vegetables from bowl; discard marinade. Thread tofu cubes, mushrooms, and onion wedges alternately onto 8 (6-inch) skewers. Lightly coat kebabs with cooking spray; sprinkle with remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt. Place kebabs on grill rack coated with cooking spray; grill 4 minutes on each side or until lightly browned. Serve with rice.
