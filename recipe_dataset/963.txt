Beef Satay With Peanut Sauce
Â½ cup smooth peanut butter
2 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1  .92-ounce package Good Seasons Roasted Garlic salad-dressing mix
1 pound presliced sirloin
1 tablespoon sesame oil
Wooden skewers soaked in water
In a small bowl, stir together the peanut butter, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of the dressing mix, and 3/4 cup water and set aside.
If the beef strips have not already been flattened, gently pound them flat with a rolling pin. In a bowl, toss together the beef, oil, and remaining salad-dressing mix. Coat each strip of beef well and thread a skewer through it. Broil 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve the satays hot with the dipping sauce.
If you made it from scratch: 1 hour
