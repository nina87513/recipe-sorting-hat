Pistachio Brittle
1¼ cups unsalted pistachios
¼ cup unsalted sunflower seed kernels
½ teaspoon ground cardamom
.13  to 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
2 cups sugar
¾ cup light-colored corn syrup
½ cup water
Dash of kosher salt
2 teaspoons unsalted butter
1½ teaspoons baking soda
Cooking spray
Combine the first 4 ingredients, tossing to coat.
Combine sugar, syrup, water, and salt in a heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cook 25 minutes or until golden and a candy thermometer registers 340°, stirring occasionally. Stir in pistachio mixture and butter, stirring rapidly. Remove from heat; stir in baking soda (mixture will bubble). Rapidly spread mixture onto a jelly roll pan coated with cooking spray. Cool completely, and break into small pieces.
