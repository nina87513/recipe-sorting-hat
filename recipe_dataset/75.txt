4 teaspoons cornstarch, divided
5 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce, divided
1 teaspoon minced peeled fresh ginger
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon Shaoxing (Chinese rice wine) or dry sherry
.13 teaspoon white pepper
2  garlic cloves, minced
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into 2 x 1/2inch-thick pieces
½ cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon brown sugar
3 tablespoons ketchup
2½ tablespoons rice vinegar
2 teaspoons chile paste
1 teaspoon dark sesame oil
1 tablespoon canola oil, divided
1 cup (1/2-inch) diced onion
1 cup (1/2-inch) diced green bell pepper
1 cup (1/2-inch) diced medium red bell pepper
½ cup (1-inch) slices green onions
1 cup (1/2-inch) diced fresh pineapple
Combine 2 teaspoons cornstarch, 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce, and next 5 ingredients (through garlic) in a medium bowl. Add chicken; stir well to coat. Set aside.
Combine chicken broth, remaining 2 teaspoons cornstarch, brown sugar, remaining 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce, ketchup, vinegar, chile paste, and sesame oil.
Heat 1/2 teaspoon canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add diced onion, bell peppers, and green onions to pan; sauté 4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Transfer to a bowl.
Heat remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons canola oil in pan. Add chicken mixture to pan, and spread in an even layer; cook, without stirring, 1 minute. Sauté an additional 3 minutes or until chicken is done.
Return vegetable mixture to pan. Add soy sauce mixture and pineapple, stirring well to combine. Bring to a boil; cook 1 minute or until thickened, stirring constantly.
