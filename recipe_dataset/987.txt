Vietnamese Shrimp Lettuce Wraps with Spicy Lime Dipping Sauce
¾ pound (16 to 20 per lb.) raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
1  package (3 3/4 oz.) cellophane noodles (see notes)
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
½  to 1 teaspoon hot chile flakes
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (about 3 small limes)
2  cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon sugar
4 tablespoons Asian fish sauce (nuoc mam or nam pla)
2  heads Boston or butter lettuce, cores trimmed and leaves separated, rinsed, and drained
1  large carrot, peeled, ends trimmed, and grated lengthwise into ribbons
¼ cup basil leaves
¼ cup cilantro leaves
¼ cup mint leaves
¼ cup dry-roasted peanuts, finely chopped
Put shrimp, salt, and pepper in a pot and add cold water to just cover shrimp. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook until shrimp are bright pink and tails are curled, about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to a colander and let cool.
Put cellophane noodles in a medium pot and cover with hot water. Cover pot and set aside until noodles are softened, at least 15 minutes. Drain noodles and (using kitchen scissors) cut into 2- to 3-inch pieces. Return noodles to pot, drizzle with rice vinegar, and toss. Cover and set aside.
In a small bowl, mix chile flakes and lime juice and let sit several minutes. Add garlic, sugar, and fish sauce; whisk until sugar is dissolved. Transfer sauce to a serving dish.
To assemble wraps, arrange some noodles in the middle of each lettuce leaf and top with 1 shrimp. Garnish with carrot, basil, cilantro, mint, and peanuts. Tuck up the bottom of each leaf and fold sides inward to eat. Drizzle with or dip into sauce.
