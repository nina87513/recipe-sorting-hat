Falafel-Stuffed Pitas
Falafel:
¼ cup dry breadcrumbs
¼ cup chopped cilantro
1½ teaspoons ground cumin
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground red pepper
2  garlic cloves, crushed
1  large egg
1  (15-ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained
1 tablespoon olive oil
Sauce:
½ cup plain low-fat yogurt
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons tahini (sesame-seed paste)
1  garlic clove, minced
Remaining ingredients:
4  (6-inch) whole wheat pitas, cut in half
8  curly leaf lettuce leaves
16  (1/4-inch-thick) slices tomato
To prepare falafel, place first 8 ingredients in a food processor; process mixture until smooth. Divide mixture into 16 equal portions, and shape each portion into a 1/4-inch-thick patty. Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the patties, and cook 5 minutes on each side or until patties are browned.
To prepare sauce, combine yogurt, lemon juice, tahini, and 1 garlic clove, stirring mixture with a whisk. Spread about 1 1/2 tablespoons tahini sauce into each pita half. Fill each pita half with 1 lettuce leaf, 2 tomato slices, and 2 patties.
