Black Bean & Zucchini Quesadillas
½ cup canned black beans, rinsed and drained
2 tablespoons salsa
½ cup finely chopped zucchini
4  (6-inch) corn tortillas
4 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese
Combine beans and salsa in a small bowl; mash with a fork. Stir in zucchini.  Layer 1 tortilla with half the bean mixture, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese, and top with another tortilla. Repeat with remaining tortillas, bean mixture, and cheese.  In broiler or toaster oven, cook quesadillas 1 minute on each side until cheese is melted and bubbly.
