Combine garlic mixture, yogurt, and 2 teaspoons garam masala in a large zip-top plastic bag. Add lamb; seal and marinate in refrigerator 8 to 24 hours, turning bag occasionally.
Add 1 1/2 cups water to bag; seal and shake to rinse lamb. Remove lamb from bag with a slotted spoon, reserving marinade in bag. Pat lamb dry with paper towels.

Reduce heat to medium. Add cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves to pan; sauté 30 seconds. Add onion; sauté 4 minutes or until browned. Return lamb and juices to pan. Add paprika, ground red pepper, and saffron; cook 15 seconds. Add reserved marinade and tomato paste, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 1 hour or until lamb is tender. Remove from heat; stir in remaining 1/4 teaspoon garam masala, cilantro, and black pepper. Serve over rice.
