Pork Lo Mein
12 ounces soba noodles or whole-wheat spaghetti
Â¼ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon plus 1 tsp. cornstarch
2 teaspoons sugar
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2  lean, boneless center-cut pork chops (about 12 oz. total), cut into thin strips
2 teaspoons canola oil
4 cups thinly sliced cabbage (from about 1/2 head)
1  medium carrot, grated
1 cup snow peas, halved crosswise (about 3 oz.)
Salt and pepper
2  scallions, thinly sliced
Bring a large pot of water to boil. Cook soba noodles until tender, about 5 minutes, or as package label directs (spaghetti will take longer, about 10 minutes). Drain.
In a large bowl, whisk soy sauce, cornstarch, sugar, vinegar and broth. Add pork and toss to coat. Set aside to marinate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Warm oil in a large nonstick wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and marinade; stir-fry until meat is no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Add cabbage and stir-fry until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir in carrot and snow peas; cook, stirring vigorously, until snow peas are slightly softened yet firm, about 2 minutes. Stir in noodles and toss to coat with sauce and warm through, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Divide mixture among 6 bowls, sprinkle with scallions and serve.
