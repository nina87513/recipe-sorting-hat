Arroz con Pollo with Apples
2 large tart unpeeled apples, such as Granny Smith
8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
6 tablespoons olive oil
1 green pepper, coarsely chopped
1 yellow pepper, coarsely chopped
1 medium onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1  14 ½-ounce can diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon paprika
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 cup long-grain converted rice
2 cups chicken broth
¼ teaspoon fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
Quarter, core, and slice the apples into ¼-inch-thick pieces; set aside. Season the chicken with the salt and black pepper. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook 4 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Remove the chicken and set aside, leaving the oil in the pan. Add the green pepper, yellow pepper, onion, and garlic. Stir well and cook over medium heat until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and apples to the pan. Cook 8 to 10 minutes more. Add the paprika and red pepper. Stir well and add the rice. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, arrange the chicken on top of the rice mixture, and cover. Cook about 20 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Sprinkle with the parsley. Serve hot.
