Baked Beef Empanadas
1 cup finely chopped red potato
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup beef broth
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground cumin
¼ teaspoon ground allspice
¼ teaspoon black pepper
½ pound boneless beef top sirloin, trimmed and diced
1  garlic clove, minced
1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon cold water
36  won ton wrappers
Cooking spray
Fresh cilantro sprigs (optional)
Combine first 10 ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat; simmer 8 minutes or until potato is done, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Cool.
Preheat oven to 400°. Place 2 baking sheets in oven for about 10 minutes.
Drain meat mixture in a colander over a bowl. Discard liquid. Finely chop meat mixture with a knife, or place in a food processor, and pulse 2 times or until finely chopped. Combine cornstarch and water, stirring with a whisk.
Working with one won ton wrapper at a time (cover the remaining won ton wrappers with a damp towel to keep them from drying), spoon 1 tablespoon beef mixture into center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of each wrapper with the cornstarch mixture. Bring 2 opposite corners together. Pinch the points to seal, forming a triangle. Place filled wrapper on a wire rack. Repeat the procedure with the remaining beef mixture, won ton wrappers, and cornstarch mixture.
Remove the baking sheets from the oven; coat baking sheets with cooking spray. Arrange the empanadas in a single layer on baking sheets. Coat the empanadas with cooking spray. Bake at 400° for 8 minutes or until golden, turning once. Garnish with cilantro, if desired.
