Enchiladas:
8 ounces ground sirloin
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cups chopped onion
4 teaspoons minced fresh garlic
1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
½ teaspoon ground cumin
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon no-salt-added tomato paste
 cup rinsed and drained organic black beans
½ cup fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
4 cups water
12  (6-inch) corn tortillas, at room temperature
Cooking spray
2½ ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (about 2/3 cup packed)
2 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (about 1/2 cup packed)
3  green onions, thinly sliced and divided
6 tablespoons Mexican crema
Preheat oven to 400°.
To prepare sauce, place ancho chiles in a medium saucepan. Add 3 cups broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in 1 torn tortilla; simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour chile mixture into a blender; let stand 10 minutes. Add cilantro, 2 teaspoons garlic, and 2 coarsely chopped green onions to blender; process until smooth. Return mixture to pan; bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook until reduced to 2 cups (about 7 minutes), stirring occasionally. Remove sauce from heat.
To prepare enchiladas, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef; sauté 5 minutes or until browned. Remove beef from pan using a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Wipe pan with paper towels. Return pan to medium heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add onion; cook 8 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add garlic and next 3 ingredients (through salt); cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in tomato paste; cook 1 minute, stirring frequently. Stir in drained beef, beans, and 1/2 cup broth; bring to a boil, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Cook 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; stir in lime juice.
Place 4 cups water in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer. Working with 1 tortilla at a time, dip tortillas in simmering water 2 to 3 seconds each or until softened. Place one tortilla on a flat work surface; spoon 3 tablespoons beef mixture onto 1 end of each tortilla. Roll enchiladas up jelly-roll style. Repeat procedure with remaining tortillas and beef mixture. Spread 1/2 cup sauce in the bottom of a 13 x 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish coated with cooking spray. Arrange enchiladas, seam-side down, in prepared dish. Pour remaining sauce over enchiladas. Top with cheeses. Bake at 400° for 20 minutes or until lightly browned and bubbly. Let stand 10 minutes. Sprinkle with 3 sliced green onions; serve with crema.
