Chicken Mole
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
Coarsely  ground black pepper to taste
¼ cup olive oil, divided, or more as needed
3 tablespoons mild chili powder
1½ teaspoons ground cumin
1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate
3  14.5-ounce cans stewed tomatoes (I puree mine before adding it; my kids like it better that way.)
1  clove garlic, minced
2  green bell peppers, seeded and chopped
Sprinkle chicken with black pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil over high heat in a deep 4-quart pot. Add chicken and cook until just cooked through, stirring a few times. Set chicken aside in a covered bowl to stay warm.
Reduce heat to medium-high and add remaining oil to pot. Add chili powder, cumin, cinnamon, and cayenne, if using. Mix well, adding a little more oil if needed until spice mix is wet with oil. Heat spices until they're blackened and smoking, 4 to 6 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and add chocolate. Stir into spice mixture with a heatproof rubber spatula.
When chocolate is fully melted, add tomatoes and garlic. Bring to a boil and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir cooked chicken and green peppers into sauce and simmer 5 more minutes. Serve over hot rice.
