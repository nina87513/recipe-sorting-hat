Asian Chicken Salad Lettuce Wraps
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons miso paste
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
¼ cup mayonnaise
½ teaspoon sriracha or other hot sauce
3 cups rotisserie chicken, skin and bones removed, meat shredded
8  small leaves savoy cabbage or Bibb lettuce, from 1 small head
1  small red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
2  scallions, thinly sliced on the bias
1  to 2 Tbsp. chopped cilantro, optional
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves, optional
Place sesame seeds in a small dry skillet. Cook over medium-low heat, tossing, until golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.
In a large bowl, whisk together soy sauce, miso, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, mayonnaise and sriracha. Stir in 1/2 of sesame seeds. Add chicken and toss to coat.
Divide chicken salad among 8 lettuce-leaf cups and place on a platter. Divide bell pepper and scallions among lettuce cups. Sprinkle each cup with remaining sesame seeds and herbs, if desired. Serve immediately.
