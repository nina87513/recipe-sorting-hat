Shrimp and Cilantro Pesto Tamales
24  dried corn husks
1 cup fresh cilantro leaves
½ cup sliced green onions
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
¼ teaspoon salt
3  garlic cloves
1 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels (about 2 ears), thawed
1 pound medium shrimp, peeled, deveined, and chopped
4½ cups Basic Masa Dough
2 cups hot water
Lime wedges (optional)
Place corn husks in a large bowl; cover with water. Weight husks down with a can; soak 30 minutes. Drain husks.
Preheat oven to 450°.
Combine cilantro and next 5 ingredients (through garlic) in a food processor; process until finely chopped. Combine cilantro mixture, corn, and shrimp, tossing well to coat.
Working with one husk at a time, place about 3 tablespoons Basic Masa Dough in the center of husk about 1/2 inch from top of husk; press dough into a 4-inch-long by 3-inch-wide rectangle. Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon shrimp mixture down one side of dough. Using the corn husk as your guide, fold husk over tamale, being sure to cover filling with dough; fold over 1 more time. Fold bottom end of husk under. Place tamale, seam side down, on the rack of a broiler pan lined with a damp towel. Repeat procedure with remaining husks, Basic Masa Dough, and filling. Cover filled tamales with another damp towel. Pour 2 cups hot water in the bottom of a broiler pan; top with prepared rack.
Steam the tamales at 450° for 55 minutes, adding water as necessary to maintain a depth of about 1/2 inch. Let tamales stand 10 minutes. Serve with lime wedges, if desired.
