Spinach and Mushroom Crêpes
Basic Buckwheat Crêpes
Rinse, trim, and thinly slice 1 1/3 pounds brown or white mushrooms. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium heat, stir mushrooms often in 2 tablespoons olive oil until browned, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon dried thyme and salt and pepper to taste.
Spread about 2 tablespoons fresh chèvre (goat cheese), 1/3 cup rinsed fresh spinach leaves, and 1/4 cup mushroom mixture down the center of each Basic Buckwheat Crêpe in pan (step 4 of crêpe recipe). Cook until bottom of crêpe is browned, about 1 minute, then fold two edges over filling, leaving a little exposed.
