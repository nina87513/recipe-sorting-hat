Bouillabaisse Broth
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped fennel
3  peeled, pressed cloves garlic
5 cups fat-skimmed chicken broth
1 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon tomato paste
Â½ teaspoon dried thyme
.06 teaspoon powdered saffron or 1/4  ground turmeric
In a 2 1/2- to 3-quart pan over medium-high heat, frequently stir olive oil, onion, fennel, and garlic until onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, white wine, tomato paste, thyme, and saffron or turmeric; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until vegetables are soft when pressed, about 15 minutes. Measure broth; if less than 6 cups, add more fat-skimmed chicken broth or water.
