Falafel Burgers with Hummus
2  15-oz. cans chickpeas, drained, rinsed
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4  cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon tahini
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 cup chopped parsley
4 teaspoons ground cumin
½ cup panko
2  large eggs, beaten
2  scallions, chopped
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
Toasted pitas, lettuce, pickles, sliced tomato, red onion, for serving
In a food processor, combine 1/2 cup chickpeas, 3 Tbsp. oil, 2 cloves garlic, tahini, lemon juice and 2 Tbsp. water. Purée until spreadable. Scrape hummus into a small bowl.
Wipe out food processor. Add remaining chickpeas and garlic, parsley and cumin. Pulse until finely chopped. Transfer chickpea mixture to a bowl. Stir in panko, eggs, scallions, salt and pepper. Form into 4 1/2-inch-thick burgers.
In a large nonstick skillet, heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil over medium heat. Cook burgers, turning once, until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Spread hummus into toasted pitas and fill with burgers. Add lettuce, pickles, tomato and onion. Serve with sweet potato fries if you like.
