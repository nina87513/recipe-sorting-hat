Chipotle Fish Tostadas
3  quarts water
2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1  medium onion, quartered
3  garlic cloves, smashed
½ teaspoon dried oregano
1  bay leaf
½  bunch fresh cilantro, tied with string
2 pounds firm white fish fillets
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  garlic cloves, pressed
1  (14 1/2-ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
2  to 3 canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, seeded, finely chopped, and divided
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
 cup mayonnaise
2 teaspoons adobo sauce from chipotle chiles in adobo
1 cup vegetable oil
12  corn tortillas
6 cups shredded iceberg lettuce
2  avocados, sliced
Garnishes: fresh cilantro, lime wedges
Bring first 7 ingredients to a boil in a 6-quart Dutch oven. Add fish, reduce heat, and simmer 3 minutes. Drain well, reserving fish but discarding onion, garlic, bay leaf, and cilantro. Flake fish, and set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pressed garlic cloves, and sauté 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, 1 or 2 chopped chipotle chiles, cloves, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon lime juice. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes or until liquid almost evaporates. Process tomato mixture in a blender until smooth; return to skillet. Add fish to tomato mixture, and cook 1 minute or until thoroughly heated. Remove from heat, cover, and keep warm.
Stir remaining chipotle chile into mayonnaise. Stir in 2 teaspoons adobo sauce until blended.
Heat vegetable oil in a 9-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Fry tortillas, one at a time, in hot oil 1 minute or until richly browned and crisp, turning once or twice. Drain on paper towels.
Spread chipotle mayonnaise evenly on tortillas. Top each tortilla with 1/3 cup fish mixture, 1/2 cup lettuce, and avocado slices. Garnish, if desired.
Note: Try this recipe with rotisserie chicken in place of the fish for a quick weeknight dinner.
