Spanish-Style Snapper with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce
½ ounce cubed sourdough bread
1 cup chopped bottled roasted red bell peppers, rinsed and drained
1½ tablespoons sherry vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
.13 teaspoon ground red pepper
2  garlic cloves, minced
4  (6-ounce) skin-on snapper fillets or skinless catfish or tilapia fillets
1 tablespoon fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
Place bread in a small bowl; cover with water. Let stand 5 minutes; drain. Combine soaked bread, bell peppers, sherry vinegar, 1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, paprika, ground red pepper, and garlic in the bowl of a mini food processor; process until smooth.
Cut 3 (1/4-inch-deep) slits in the skin of each fillet. Sprinkle flesh side of fillets evenly with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add fillets, skin side down, to pan; cook 6 minutes. Turn and cook 2 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Place 1 fillet on each of 4 plates; top each serving with 3 tablespoons red pepper mixture. Sprinkle with parsley.
