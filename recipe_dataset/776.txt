Slow Cooker Turkey Mole
 cup fresh orange juice (about 1 orange)
 cup fresh lime juice (about 3 limes), divided
3½ pounds turkey drumsticks (skin-on) (about 4 drumsticks)
5  (dried) ancho chiles
5  (dried) guajillo chiles
6 cups unsalted chicken stock
1 cup sliced plantain, soft, black, and very ripe
½ cup pecan halves, deeply toasted
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate
1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves
1 teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon ground cumin
Cooking spray
½ cup diced celery
24  garlic cloves, halved lengthwise
1  large yellow onion, thinly vertically sliced
2 tablespoons light brown sugar (optional)
½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
½ cup thinly sliced radishes
Combine orange juice, 1/4 cup lime juice, and turkey; refrigerate 30 minutes. Remove turkey from marinade; discard marinade. Pat turkey dry.
While turkey marinates, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chiles; toast 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly charred. Cool slightly. Remove and discard stems; keep seeds.
Bring stock to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add plantain, chiles, and pecans; simmer 20 minutes or until chiles are very soft.
Reduce heat to low. Add chocolate, stirring to prevent scorching. Add oregano, salt, and cumin; simmer 10 minutes.
Pour sauce into a blender. Remove center piece of blender lid (to allow steam to escape); secure lid on blender. Place a towel over opening in lid. Blend until smooth.
Heat skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add turkey; cook 10 minutes, browning on all sides.
Scatter celery, garlic, and onion in a 6-quart slow cooker. Top with turkey and sauce; cover and cook on LOW for 5 hours or until meat is very tender.
Remove turkey. Shred meat; discard bones and skin. Stir meat, remaining lime juice, and sugar, if desired, into sauce. Top with cilantro and radishes.
