Greek-Style Baby Potatoes
1  red bell pepper, halved lengthwise and seeded
4 cups olive oil
1½ pounds baby new potatoes, halved (about 4 cups)
4  fresh bay leaves
12  Castelvetrano or other large olives, halved (about 1/3 cup)
½ cup loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
Kosher salt and black pepper
Preheat broiler. Place bell pepper halves cut-side down on a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush tops with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Broil 4 inches from heat until charred, 6 to 8 minutes. Place in a bowl; cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let stand 10 minutes. Peel and cut into strips.
Combine potatoes, bay leaves and remaining oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Simmer until potatoes are very tender, 12 to 15 minutes.
Transfer potatoes to a bowl with a slotted spoon; discard bay leaves. Stir in olives, parsley, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Serve warm.
