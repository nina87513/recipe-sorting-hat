Chorizo and Kale-Stuffed Sweet Potatoes with Zucchini-Arugula Salad
4  (8-ounce) sweet potatoes
¼ cup white vinegar
3½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons paprika
1½ tablespoons ground cumin
1½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1¼ teaspoons black pepper, divided
10  garlic cloves, minced
1 pound ground turkey breast
1 pound ground pork
6 cups torn curly kale
¼ cup golden raisins
1½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided
2 ounces goat cheese, crumbled (about 1/2 cup)
3 cups baby arugula
8 ounces zucchini, shaved into long ribbons
Preheat oven to 400°.
Pierce potatoes with a fork; wrap each in foil. Bake at 400° for 1 hour.
Combine vinegar, 2 tablespoons oil, paprika, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and garlic in a bowl. Combine turkey and pork in a bowl, mixing well with hands. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add turkey mixture to pan; cook 7 minutes or until done, stirring to crumble. Drain any excess liquid from meat mixture in pan; return to medium-high heat. Stir in vinegar mixture; cook 2 minutes or until liquid almost evaporates. Place chorizo in a bowl. Reserve 3 2/3 cups chorizo for Loaded Chorizo Nachos and Saucy Chorizo and Egg Skillet. Wipe pan clean with a paper towel.
Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in pan over medium-high heat; swirl to coat. Add kale; cover and cook 4 minutes. Stir in 1 1/3 cups chorizo, 1/4 teaspoon salt, raisins, and 1 1/2 teaspoons juice. Cut a lengthwise slit in each potato; gently squeeze at both ends to open. Spoon about 3/4 cup kale mixture onto each potato; top each with 2 tablespoons cheese.
Combine remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and remaining 1 tablespoon juice in a large bowl. Add arugula and zucchini; toss. Serve with potatoes.
