Pork Posole
4  ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded
2 cups boiling water
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1½ pounds boneless pork loin, trimmed and cut into (1/2-inch) pieces
1½ cups chopped onion
4  garlic cloves, minced
4 cups fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons sugar
¾ teaspoon salt
2  (15.5-ounce) cans white hominy, undrained
6 tablespoons sliced radishes
6 tablespoons chopped green onions
6 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
6  lime slices
Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Place chiles in pan; flatten with a spatula. Cook 10 seconds on each side or until blackened. Combine toasted chiles and 2 cups boiling water in a bowl; let stand 10 minutes or until soft. Place chile mixture in a blender or food processor; process until smooth.
Cook cumin seeds in a large Dutch oven over medium heat for 1 minute or until toasted and fragrant. Place in a spice or coffee grinder; process until finely ground.
Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add pork; cook 5 minutes, browning on all sides. Remove pork from pan. Reduce heat to medium. Add onion and garlic to pan; cook 8 minutes or until onion is browned, stirring frequently. Stir in pork, pureed chiles, toasted ground cumin, broth, sugar, salt, and hominy; bring to a simmer. Cook 30 minutes or until pork is tender. Spoon 1 2/3 cups posole into each of 6 bowls; top each serving with 1 tablespoon radishes, 1 tablespoon green onions, and 1 tablespoon cilantro. Serve with lime slices.
