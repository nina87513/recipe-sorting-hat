Jackfruit Carnitas Tacos
2  (14. oz.) cans young jackfruit in brine, drained
6 tablespoons canola oil, divided
1  medium-size yellow onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
1  jalapeño chile, finely chopped (about 2 tbsp)
4 teaspoon minced garlic (about 3 cloves)
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
½ cup fresh orange juice (from 1 orange)
½ cup vegetable stock
2 tablespoons adobo sauce
12  (6-in.) corn tortillas
Toppings: diced mango, diced avocado, sliced radishes, fresh cilantro leaves, shredded cabbage
Lime wedges
Rinse jackfruit under cold running water; drain and pat dry with paper towels.
Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add onion, jalapeño, and garlic; cook, stirring often, until tender and beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Add jackfruit, and stir to break up fruit. Sprinkle with cumin, coriander, and smoked paprika; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in orange juice, vegetable stock, and adobo sauce; cook, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl, and wipe skillet clean.
Heat tortillas over a gas flame, if desired, and wrap in aluminum foil to keep warm. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in same skillet over medium-high. Spread half of jackfruit mixture (about 1 1/2 cups) in an even layer in skillet. Cook, without stirring, until lightly browned on bottom, about 2 minutes. Stir and cook until evenly browned and crisp in spots, 1 to 2 minutes. Divide mixture among 6 tortillas. Repeat with remaining oil and jackfruit mixture. Add desired toppings to tacos, and serve with lime wedges.
