Stir-Fried Tofu and Broccoli Lo Mein
2 cups broccoli florets
Salt
1 pound Chinese egg noodles or spaghetti
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
Â¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
2 tablespoons mirin
2 teaspoons sugar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  14-oz. package extra-firm tofu, drained, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2  cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
4  scallions, white and light green parts, finely chopped
Place broccoli florets in a microwave-safe bowl. Add 2 Tbsp. water, cover and microwave until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add noodles and cook until just tender, about 8 minutes or as package label directs. Drain, rinse under cold water and drain again. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with sesame oil. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, oyster sauce, mirin and sugar until sugar has dissolved.
Warm a wok or large skillet over high heat until very hot. Add vegetable oil and swirl to coat bottom of pan. Lightly pat tofu with paper towels to dry, add to pan and cook, turning occasionally, until golden on all sides, 2 to 4 minutes. Add garlic, ginger and scallions and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add noodles, broccoli and sauce mixture and cook, turning, until heated through, approximately 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
