Arroz con Pollo
1  olive oil
4  chicken thighs
4  chicken drumsticks
2  salt
½  fresh-ground black pepper
2  smoked ham, cut into 1/4-inch dice
1  small onion, chopped
2  cloves garlic, minced
1  red bell pepper, chopped
1  green bell pepper, chopped
1¾  canned tomatoes, drained and chopped
1  tomato paste
2  canned low-sodium chicken broth or homemade stock
1  rice, preferably long-grain
2  chopped fresh parsley
In a large, deep frying pan, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Season the chicken with 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Cook the chicken, turning, until well browned, about 8 minutes in all. Remove. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan.
Reduce the heat to moderately low. Add the ham, onion, and garlic to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion starts to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the bell peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften, about 3 minutes longer.
Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, broth, and the remaining 1 3/4 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper and bring to a simmer. Stir in the rice and add the chicken in an even layer. Simmer, partially covered, over moderately low heat until the chicken and rice are just done, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.
Wine Recommendation: This traditional Spanish favorite will work well with any smooth, full-flavored red, such as a merlot or zinfandel from California or a Rioja from Spain.
