Grilled Italian Spareribs
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1  (4- to 5-lb.) slab pork spareribs
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Grind together fennel seeds and crushed red pepper in a spice grinder. (If you don't have a spice grinder, use a heavy knife to mince the seeds and red pepper.) Combine ground spices and salt; rub mixture all over the ribs. Cover ribs, and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight, if possible. (If not, rub the ribs a minimum of 2 hours ahead of time.)
Stir together olive oil, lemon juice, rosemary, garlic, and black pepper in a small bowl. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator. Place the ribs on a platter or broiler pan, and pour the marinade from the bowl over it, rubbing it into the meat with your fingers. Let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour, turning the ribs at least once.
Preheat the broiler or gas grill to high (450°F to 550°F) 15 minutes before you are ready to cook. (If using charcoal, allow it time to form a full coating of white ash.) Place the broiler pan (or the grilling rack, if it's adjustable) about 8 inches from the source of heat. Place spareribs on the pan or grill, and brush with any remaining marinade. Cook for 30 to 35 minutes, turning rack 3 or 4 times.
