Malaysian Barbecue-Glazed Halibut
4  (6-ounce) halibut fillets
¼ teaspoon salt
Cooking spray
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon honey
1½ teaspoons rice vinegar
1½ teaspoons hoisin sauce
1 teaspoon fish sauce
½ teaspoon chile paste with garlic (such as sambal oelek)
¼ teaspoon cornstarch
Lemon wedges (optional)
Sprinkle fish fillets evenly with salt. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat the pan with cooking spray. Add fish to pan; sauté 5 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork or until desired degree of doneness.
Combine lemon juice and the next 7 ingredients (through cornstarch) in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring well; bring to a boil. Cook 20 seconds, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Brush about 1 tablespoon sauce over each fillet. Serve with lemon wedges, if desired.
