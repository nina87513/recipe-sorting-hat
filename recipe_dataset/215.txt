Pork Ragout
1 pound boned pork loin
1  (4-ounce) link hot turkey Italian sausage
1 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon chopped fresh or 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
¾ cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
¾ cup Zinfandel or other dry red wine
1  (28-ounce) can Italian-style whole tomatoes, undrained and chopped
4 cups hot cooked penne (about 8 ounces uncooked tube-shaped pasta)
¼ cup (1 ounce) grated fresh Romano cheese
Fresh rosemary sprigs (optional)
Trim fat from pork; cut pork into 1/4-inch cubes.
Remove casing from sausage. Cook sausage in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until browned; stir to crumble. Remove sausage from pan with a slotted spoon. Add onion to pan; saute 4 minutes or until lightly browned. Add pork, and sauté 5 minutes. Add sausage, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Stir in broth and wine, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Bring to a boil; cook for 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes. Serve over pasta, and sprinkle with cheese. Garnish with rosemary sprigs, if desired.
