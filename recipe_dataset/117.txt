Stir-Fried Moo Shu Vegetable Wraps
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
8 ounces reduced-fat firm tofu, drained and cut into 3/4-inch cubes
2 cups sliced shiitake mushroom caps (about 8 ounces mushrooms)
2 cups packaged broccoli coleslaw (such as River Ranch)
1 cup red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips
½ cup (1/2-inch) diagonally cut green onions
1 tablespoon bottled minced garlic
1 teaspoon bottled ground fresh ginger (such as Spice World)
2 teaspoons dark sesame oil
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
8  (7-inch) flour tortillas
¼ cup plum sauce
Combine soy sauce and tofu in a small bowl. Combine mushrooms and next 5 ingredients (mushrooms through ginger) in a medium bowl.
Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add vegetables; stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add tofu; stir-fry 1 minute. Stir in hoisin sauce and crushed red pepper; stir-fry for 1 minute or until vegetables are crisp-tender.
Stack tortillas; wrap in damp paper towels, and microwave at high for 25 seconds. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoons plum sauce over each tortilla. Top each tortilla with about 1/3 cup tofu mixture; roll up.
