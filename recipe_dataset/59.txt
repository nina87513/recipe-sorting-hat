18  (12-inch) wooden skewers
1  pineapple, cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch chunks, divided
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine), white wine, or dry vermouth
1½ tablespoons freshly grated ginger

Sweet and Sour Sauce
Soak wooden skewers in water at least 30 minutes.
Place 1 cup pineapple chunks in a blender with 1 tablespoon water; puree. Combine 3 tablespoons pineapple puree with soy sauce and next 4 ingredients in a large bowl. (Save remaining puree for sauce.) Add pork, and marinate 1 hour. (Do not marinate longer.)
Remove meat from marinade, discarding marinade. Thread pork onto skewers, alternating with peppers, onion, and remaining pineapple.
Grill kabobs on greased grill rack over medium heat (325° to 350°) for 5 minutes. Brush kabobs with Sweet and Sour Sauce, and grill 5 minutes or until done. Serve remaining sauce on the side.
