¼ cup red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon honey
Salt
½  small red onion, sliced
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
½  avocado, pitted, peeled and chopped
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, plus sprigs for garnish
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
2 teaspoons chopped seeded jalapeno
1  small clove garlic, chopped

1 tablespoon chili powder
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken thighs
8  6-inch corn tortillas, warmed
2 cups sliced napa cabbage
Sour cream, hot sauce, sliced radishes and additional toppings, optional
Combine vinegar, honey and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Stir in onion. Let stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, for at least 30 minutes.
Pulse peas, avocado, chopped cilantro, lime juice, jalapeño, garlic, 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1/4 tsp. salt in a food processor until combined but not smooth. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate.
Mix 1 Tbsp. oil, chili powder, remaining 1 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. salt in a small bowl. Rub chicken all over with spice mixture. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken, turning, until cooked through, about 12 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes on a cutting board, then shred. Drain onion.
Fill tortillas with cabbage, pea guacamole, chicken, pickled onions and additional toppings, if desired. Garnish with cilantro sprigs. Serve immediately.
