Beef Chorizo Tacos with Cabbage Slaw
4 cups very thinly sliced red cabbage
 cup cilantro leaves
3 tablespoons white vinegar, divided
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
¾ teaspoon salt, divided
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoons ground cumin
½ teaspoon black pepper
5  garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 pound 90% lean ground sirloin
12  (6-inch) corn tortillas
Combine cabbage and cilantro in a medium bowl.
Combine 1 tablespoon vinegar, 1 tablespoon oil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl, stirring with a fork or whisk.
Drizzle vinegar ­mixture over cabbage mixture; toss well to combine. Set aside.
Combine remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, paprika, cumin, pepper, and garlic, stirring well with a fork or whisk.
Heat a large nonstick ­skillet over ­medium-high heat. Add beef; cook 5 minutes or until browned and done, stirring to crumble.
Stir in vinegar-spice mixture; cook 2 minutes or until liquid almost evaporates.
Heat tortillas over medium-high heat directly on the eye of a gas or electric burner or in a skillet for about 10 ­seconds on each side or until lightly charred.
Spoon about 1/4 cup beef mixture and 1/4 cup slaw into each tortilla.
Riff: Swap in ground turkey or ground chicken for ground beef.
Riff: Try this as a modern take on taco salad: Chop cabbage, and use the slaw as a salad base; top with chorizo, and serve with tortilla chips.
Riff: For crunchy tostadas, crisp the tortillas in a 400° oven, and assemble chorizo and slaw on top.
