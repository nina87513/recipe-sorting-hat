Chiles Rellenos
6  poblano chiles or 4 small green bell peppers
1  15 1/4-ounce can kidney beans, drained
1  8-ounce package shredded Monterey Jack cheese
¼ cup raisins
¼ cup salsa
2 teaspoons chili powder
Cut a slit lengthwise in each chile and carefully scoop out the seeds and ribs. In a medium bowl, combine the beans, cheese, raisins, salsa, and chili powder. Stuff the peppers with the filling.
Light a charcoal grill and allow the coals to burn until covered with gray ash or heat a gas grill to medium. Place peppers on grill and cook, turning frequently, until they are soft and the cheese has melted.
