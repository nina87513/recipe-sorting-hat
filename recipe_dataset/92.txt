Easy Egg Rolls With Sweet-and-Sour Orange Dipping Sauce
1 pound hot ground pork sausage
1½ tablespoons grated fresh ginger
2  garlic cloves, pressed
1  (10-oz.) bag shredded coleslaw mix
1  (16-oz.) package egg roll wrappers
Vegetable oil
Sweet-and-Sour Orange Dipping Sauce
Brown sausage in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring until it crumbles and is no longer pink. Drain excess grease, and pat dry with paper towels, if necessary. Return sausage to skillet. Stir in ginger and garlic; cook 1 minute. Add coleslaw mix, and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes or until coleslaw mix is tender; let stand 30 minutes to cool.
Spoon 1/4 cup sausage mixture in center of each egg roll wrapper. Fold top corner of each wrapper over filling; fold left and right corners over filling. Lightly brush remaining corner with water; tightly roll filled end toward remaining corner, and gently press to seal.
Pour vegetable oil to a depth of 2 inches into a wok or Dutch oven; heat to 375°. Fry, in batches, 2 to 3 minutes or until golden, turning once; drain on paper towels.
Note: Egg rolls can be assembled up to a day ahead. Place them in a single layer on a baking sheet, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and chill. Fry according to recipe instructions. Do not fry them ahead of time or fry and freeze. We weren't happy with the results.
