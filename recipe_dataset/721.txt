Gorditas with Turkey Mole
2 cups masa harina
1¼ cups chicken broth
¼ cup vegetable shortening
½ cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
Vegetable oil
1 cup refried beans or
1 cup drained and mashed Buzz's Pot of Beans
Turkey Mole
Toppings
Stir together masa harina and broth in a large mixing bowl. Cover and let stand 30 minutes. Add shortening, flour, salt, and baking powder; beat at medium speed with an electric mixer until smooth.
Divide dough into 12 golf-size balls. Arrange on wax paper, and cover with damp towels. Pat each ball of dough into a 3-inch circle. (Lightly oil fingers to keep mixture from sticking.) Pinch edges of circles to form a ridge, and press a well into each center to hold toppings. Cover with a damp towel to prevent dough from drying.
Pour oil to a depth of 1/4 inch into a large skillet; heat to 350°. Fry gorditas, in batches, 2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
Dollop each gordita with 2 tablespoons refried beans; spoon 1 tablespoon Turkey Mole over beans on each gordita. (Reserve extra beans and mole for other uses.) Top gorditas with desired toppings, and garnish, if desired.
Tip: Fill a squirt bottle with sour cream. Squeeze onto top of gordita.
Note: Masa harina is corn flour traditionally used to make corn tortillas. It can be found in the ethnic foods section of larger grocery stores.
