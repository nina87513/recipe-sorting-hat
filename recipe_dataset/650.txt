Double-Bean Burritos
1  (3 1/2-ounce) bag boil-in-bag brown rice
1 cup chunky bottled salsa
1  (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
6  (10-inch) flour tortillas
6 tablespoons bean dip (such as Frito Lay)
¾ cup (3 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeño peppers
1  peeled avocado, cut into 6 slices
12  cilantro sprigs
6  lime wedges (optional)
Cook rice according to package directions, omitting salt and fat.
While rice cooks, combine salsa and black beans in a small saucepan; cook over medium heat 5 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Stack tortillas; wrap stack in damp paper towels. Microwave at high 25 seconds or until warm.
Spread 1 tablespoon bean dip over each tortilla; top each tortilla with 1/4 cup rice, 1/3 cup black bean mixture, 2 tablespoons cheese, 1 avocado slice, and 2 cilantro sprigs; roll up. Serve with lime wedges, if desired.
