2 tablespoons canola oil
2 cups chopped white onion
1 cup diced celery

Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add chicken to pan, and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook 4 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. Add sausage; sauté 2 minutes. Remove mixture from pan.
Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add white onion, celery, bell peppers, and garlic; sauté 8 minutes or until tender, scraping pan occasionally to loosen browned bits. Stir in remaining 1 teaspoon salt, paprika, and next 4 ingredients (through bay leaves); sauté 1 minute. Add oats; cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add stock and tomatoes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 4 minutes. Return chicken mixture to pan, and add shrimp; cook 5 minutes or until shrimp and oats are done and mixture thickens. Sprinkle with green onions.
