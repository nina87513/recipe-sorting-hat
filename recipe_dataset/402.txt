Sweet Potato Samosas
3 cups (1/2-inch) cubed peeled sweet potato (about 1 pound)
½ cup water
1½ cups frozen petite green peas
2 teaspoons olive oil
½ cup chopped onion
4  garlic cloves, minced
1½ teaspoons mustard seeds
1½ teaspoons curry powder
½ teaspoon salt
.13  to 1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper
12  Savory Cornmeal-Whole Wheat Dough circles
Combine sweet potato and 1/2 cup water in a microwave-safe pie plate or bowl; lightly cover with wax paper. Microwave at high 8 minutes or until tender, stirring every 3 minutes. Drain; coarsely mash sweet potato. Stir in peas.
Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté 4 minutes. Add mustard seeds and curry powder; sauté 2 minutes. Add onion mixture, salt, and pepper to potato mixture; stir well. Cool slightly.
Preheat oven to 425°.
Place Savory Cornmeal-Whole Wheat Dough circles on a lightly floured surface. Spoon 1/4 cup potato mixture into center of each dough circle. Fold dough over filling; press edges together with a fork or fingers to seal. Place samosas on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Pierce top of each samosa once with a fork. Bake at 425° for 19 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm.
