Thai Chicken Soup With Coconut and Lime
1 tablespoon canola oil
2  lemongrass stalks, tough parts discarded, bottom bulb finely chopped
1  large shallot, thinly sliced
4  quarter-size slices fresh ginger, peeled and sliced
2½ cups low-sodium chicken broth
4 teaspoons Asian fish sauce
2 teaspoons packed brown sugar
4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded and caps thinly sliced
½  small red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced, slices halved on diagonal
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut crosswise into thin strips
1  13.5-oz. can coconut milk
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
 cup roughly torn cilantro
2  scallions, thinly sliced (about 1/4 cup)
Thai chilies, thinly sliced, optional
Lime wedges, for serving
Warm a large saucepan over medium heat. Add oil; swirl to coat. Add lemongrass, shallot and ginger; cook, stirring, until fragrant and beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add broth, fish sauce and sugar; bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain, pressing on solids; discard solids.
Return soup to pan; bring back to a simmer over medium-low heat. Stir in mushrooms and bell pepper; cook for 2 minutes. Stir in chicken; cook until just opaque, about 2 minutes longer. Stir in coconut milk and lime juice; cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through. Ladle into serving bowls and top with cilantro, scallions and chilies, if desired. Serve with lime wedges.
