Hot and Sour Soup with Tofu
1  (14-ounce) package firm water-packed tofu, drained
1¾ cups water, divided
1  (1/2-ounce) package dried sliced shiitake mushroom caps
4 cups fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
¼ cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons less-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon finely chopped peeled fresh ginger
2 teaspoons sugar
¾ teaspoon white pepper
1  garlic clove, minced
2½ tablespoons cornstarch
½ cup canned sliced bamboo shoots, drained and cut into julienne strips
1  large egg, lightly beaten
½ cup thinly diagonally sliced green onion tops
Place tofu on several layers of paper towels. Cover tofu with several more layers of paper towels; top with a cast-iron skillet or other heavy pan. Let stand 30 minutes. Discard paper towels. Cut tofu into 1-inch cubes.
Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan; remove from heat. Stir in mushrooms; let stand 30 minutes. Stir in broth and next 6 ingredients (through garlic); bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Combine remaining 1/4 cup water and cornstarch in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk until smooth. Stir cornstarch mixture, tofu, and bamboo shoots into broth mixture; bring to a boil. Cook 1 minute, stirring occasionally; remove from heat. Slowly drizzle egg into broth mixture (do not stir). Place pan over low heat; cook 1 minute. Stir soup gently to combine. Sprinkle with green onions.
