Cumin-Crusted Pork Soft Tacos
Pork:
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon cumin seeds, crushed
1 teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
2  (1-pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed
1 tablespoon olive oil
Salsa:
2 cups frozen whole-kernel corn, thawed
1 cup quartered grape tomatoes
1 cup cubed peeled avocado
½ cup diced red onion
 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
½ teaspoon salt
2  (15-ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
Remaining ingredients:
2 cups reduced-fat sour cream
1 tablespoon canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce, chopped
30  (6-inch) corn tortillas
Preheat oven to 425°.
To prepare pork, combine first 5 ingredients. Rub cumin mixture over pork. Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork; cook 4 minutes or until browned on all sides. Bake at 425° for 12 minutes or until a thermometer registers 155°. Remove pork from oven; let stand 5 minutes. Cut pork across grain into thin slices.
To prepare salsa, combine corn and next 7 ingredients (through beans).
Combine sour cream and chipotle in a blender; process until smooth.
Wrap tortillas, 3 at a time, in a damp paper towel. Microwave at high 20 seconds. Spoon about 1 ounce pork onto each tortilla. Top each tortilla with about 2 tablespoons salsa and about 2 teaspoons sour cream mixture. Fold in half.
