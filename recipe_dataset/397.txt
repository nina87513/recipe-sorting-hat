Yogurt Honey Jelly with Strawberries and Roses
1  envelope (1/4 oz.) powdered gelatin
½ cup heavy whipping cream
½ teaspoon vanilla
4 tablespoons honey, or to taste
Pinch of salt
1½ cups plain Greek yogurt
1 cup hulled strawberries, sliced lengthwise
1 tablespoon sugar
½ teaspoon rose water (optional; see Notes)
¼ cup rose petals (see Notes)
Put gelatin and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan and let soften for a few minutes. Meanwhile, pour cream and vanilla into a medium bowl and use an electric mixer to whip the mixture into soft peaks.
Heat gelatin mixture gently over low heat until gelatin dissolves completely. Stir in honey and salt; remove from heat.
Whisk yogurt in a medium bowl. Whisk some yogurt into gelatin-honey mixture; then whisk that mixture into rest of yogurt. Fold whipped cream into yogurt mixture and pour into a 6-in. cake pan. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until set, at least 1 hour.
Combine strawberries, sugar, and rose water in a small bowl and mix gently. (If you'd like a bit of syrup, let mixture sit for 20 to 30 minutes before serving.)
To unmold, dip underside of cake pan in a large bowl of hot water for a minute or so. Remove from water and set a serving plate face down on top. Holding plate in place, quickly invert cake pan to release jelly (tap pan if necessary). Top with strawberries and rose petals.
