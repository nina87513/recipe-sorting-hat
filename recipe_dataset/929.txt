Fish Chowder Croquettes with Rum Aïoli
2  medium scallops, diced
6 ounces red snapper, diced
1  large russet potato, peeled and boiled until fork tender
2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill
2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives
2 teaspoons mayonnaise
1 teaspoon mustard
1 teaspoon fish sauce
2  garlic cloves, minced
 cup diced Portuguese chorizo
6 ounces jumbo lump crabmeat, drained and picked
4 tablespoons cornstarch
2  large eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup panko
3 cups canola oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Rum Aïoli
Prepared pepper sauce (optional)
Combine scallops and snapper in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until combined. Combine potato, dill, and next 5 ingredients in a large bowl; mash well with a potato masher or large fork. Stir in scallop mixture, chorizo, and crabmeat; stir well to combine.
Place cornstarch, eggs, and panko in 3 separate shallow containers. Divide croquette mixture into 18 equal portions; form portions into balls. Roll each ball in cornstarch, then eggs, then panko. Set aside on a plate.
Heat oil in a large pot to 330°. Carefully fry croquettes, in batches, 3 to 5 minutes or until golden brown. Remove croquettes from oil using a slotted spoon; place on a paper towel-lined platter. Immediately sprinkle croquettes with kosher salt and black pepper as they are removed from oil. Serve with Rum Aïoli and pepper sauce, if desired.
