Steak Salad Niçoise
2  large eggs (refrigerator-cold)
10 ounce red potatoes
12 ounces haricots verts (French green beans)
Cooking spray
8 ounces trimmed New York strip steak
½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
2½ tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1  small garlic clove, grated
3 cups chopped romaine lettuce
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
20  niçoise olives
Place eggs and potatoes in a large saucepan; cover with cold water to 2 inches above eggs. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and cook 7 minutes. Remove eggs from pan; place in a large ice water-filled bowl. Continue cooking potatoes 13 more minutes or until tender. Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon. Cool slightly; cut into quarters. Add beans to boiling water; cook 4 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain and place in ice water. Drain well; place potatoes and beans in a large bowl. Peel eggs; cut into quarters, and set aside.
Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add steak to pan; cook 4 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. Remove from pan; let stand 5 minutes. Cut across grain into thin slices; sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.
Combine remaining 3/8 teaspoon salt, remaining 3/8 teaspoon pepper, parsley, and next 5 ingredients (through garlic) in a small bowl or jar; stir with a whisk or shake until well blended. Drizzle half of dressing over potato mixture; toss to coat. Divide potatoes, beans, steak, lettuce, tomatoes, olives, and eggs evenly among 4 plates. Drizzle remaining dressing over servings.
