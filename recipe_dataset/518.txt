Easy Kimchi
1  Napa cabbage, cut into 2-inch strips
2 tablespoons garlic, minced
2 tablespoons ginger, minced
1 teaspoon sugar
3 tablespoons water
4 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes
1  large daikon radish, peeled and cut into 1-inch matchsticks
2  green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces
Place cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Mix thoroughly using gloves, if preferred. Place a heavy pot or pan on top with weights and allow cabbage to sit for 1-2 hours until wilted and water has been released.
Discard water after 1-2 hours. Rinse the cabbage 2-3 times in the sink until salt is removed and allow to drain in a colander for another 15-20 minutes.
Combine cabbage with remaining ingredients (through water) and mix. Using gloves, add the Korean red pepper flakes and begin mixing and rubbing flakes into the mixture. Add the daikon radish and green onions to mixture, stirring to combine.
Once combined, place mixture in a jar pressing down and packing tightly so that the mixture is submerged in its own liquid. Place top on jar and allow to sit at room temperature for 2-5 days. Place jar on a plate since the mixture may bubble over while fermenting.
Each day of fermentation, remove the lid to release gases and press down on the mixture to keep it submerged. You can taste a sample each day to decide if the level of fermentation is to your liking.
After 2-5 days of fermentation, store kimchi in refrigerator.
