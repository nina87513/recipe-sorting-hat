Sweet-and-Sour Chicken
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1¼ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
Salt and pepper
1  medium onion, chopped
1  green bell pepper, cored, seeded, cut into 1-inch pieces
2  cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1  20-oz. can pineapple chunks in juice
 cup apple cider vinegar
 cup packed light brown sugar
1  8-oz. can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
Cooked rice, for serving
2  scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced
Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper; cook until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a 2-quart ovenproof dish.
Heat remaining oil in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper. Cook, stirring, until onion is soft and pepper is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, then cook for 1 minute more.
Add ginger, pineapple, vinegar, sugar and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil. In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and soy sauce; stir into pineapple mixture. Cook, stirring, until sauce becomes translucent, about 1 minute. Pour over chicken; stir to combine.
Cover and bake until chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Serve over rice. Garnish with scallions.
