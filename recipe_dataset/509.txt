Sushi-Rice Salad
Rice:
2 cups uncooked sushi rice
2 cups water
1 teaspoon kosher salt
Dressing:
½ cup rice vinegar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon dark sesame oil
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon grated peeled fresh ginger
1  garlic clove, minced
¼  to 3/4 teaspoon prepared wasabi (Japanese horseradish; optional)
Remaining ingredients:
1 cup (2-inch) julienne-cut peeled English cucumber
¼ cup minced red onion
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted
1  sheet nori (seaweed), cut into 2-inch julienne strips
To prepare rice, rinse rice thoroughly in a sieve. Drain well. Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan; add rice and salt. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat; uncover and cool to room temperature.
To prepare dressing, combine vinegar and next 5 ingredients (vinegar through garlic) in a small bowl. Add wasabi, if desired. Combine cooled rice, dressing, cucumber, onion, and sesame seeds in a large bowl. Sprinkle evenly with nori.
