Tuna "Nicoise" Kabobs
½ pound new potatoes
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, divided
½ pound green beans, trimmed
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, plus more for brushing grill
1 pound tuna, cut into 1-inch pieces
6  kalamata olives, pitted and chopped
8  (8-inch) wooden skewers, soaked in water 30 minutes
1  pint cherry tomatoes (about 1/2 pound)
1  red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
1  small zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds
1  small yellow summer squash, cut into 1/2-inch rounds
2  large hard-cooked eggs, peeled and quartered
Cover potatoes with 2 inches water in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Simmer 15 minutes or until fork-tender; drain and transfer to a bowl, reserving cooking water. Halve potatoes, and toss in 1 tablespoon vinegar. Arrange on a platter.
Add the green beans to simmering water; cook 4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain; rinse with cold water until cool. Transfer to platter.
Preheat grill, and lightly oil rack.
Whisk together remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar with mustard in a small bowl, and add olive oil in a slow stream until well-combined. Transfer 2 teaspoons vinaigrette to a bowl, and toss with tuna to coat. Whisk remaining vinaigrette with 1 tablespoon hot water and olives.
Drain skewers; thread 2 with tuna and remainder with vegetables. Grill fish and vegetables, turning occasionally, over moderate heat 68 minutes or until fish is cooked through and vegetables are tender. Remove from skewers; place on platter with eggs. Drizzle with vinaigrette.
