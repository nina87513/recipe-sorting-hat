3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 cups chopped leek, or to taste
3 tablespoons chopped onion, or to taste
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 ½ tablespoons honey, or to taste
½ teaspoon black pepper
1 ½ (14 ounce) packages firm water-packed tofu, cut into 1-inch-thick slabs
Vinaigrette:
1 ½ tablespoons honey, or to taste
1 ½ tablespoons light soy sauce
1 ½ tablespoons sesame oil
2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
Slaw:
1 (4 inch) cucumber, cut into matchsticks
2 small carrots, cut into matchsticks
⅓ cup matchstick-cut daikon radish
3 scallions, cut into matchsticks
12 leaves iceberg lettuce
Combine 3 tablespoons soy sauce, leek, onion, 2 tablespoons sesame oil, 1 1/2 tablespoons honey, and black pepper in a bowl. Whisk until fully combined. Add tofu and cover with plastic wrap. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours.
Whisk 1 1/2 tablespoons honey, light soy sauce, 1 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil, and gochujang together in a bowl. Toss in cucumber, carrots, daikon, and scallions. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate slaw until ready to use.
Preheat an outdoor grill to 465 degrees F (240 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate. Add the marinated tofu and grill until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Let cool; chop into 1x3-inch strips.
Toss grilled tofu into the prepared slaw. Wrap in lettuce leaves.
