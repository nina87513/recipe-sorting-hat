Vegetable and Tofu Lettuce Wraps with Miso Sambal
Miso sambal:
2 tablespoons chile paste with garlic (such as Sambal oelek)
2 tablespoons chopped peeled fresh ginger
2 tablespoons white miso (soybean paste)
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1½ tablespoons sugar
1½ teaspoons dark sesame oil
Wraps:
1 cup matchstick-cut English cucumber
½ cup cilantro sprigs
2 tablespoons chopped dry-roasted peanuts
1  (12.3-ounce) package reduced-fat firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/2-inch-thick strips
½  avocado, peeled and thinly sliced
12  large Boston lettuce leaves
To prepare miso sambal, combine the first 6 ingredients in a blender, and process until smooth.
To prepare wraps, divide cucumber, cilantro, peanuts, tofu, and avocado evenly among lettuce leaves. Drizzle each with about 1 1/2 teaspoons sambal; roll up.
