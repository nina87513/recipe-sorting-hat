Quick Paella
1 tablespoon olive oil
6 ounces Spanish chorizo, thinly sliced
2  (3.5-ounce) packages boil-in-bag brown rice (such as Uncle Ben's)
.38 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon hot smoked paprika
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1½ cups water
1  (14.5-ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes, undrained
1½ cups frozen shelled edamame
2  dozen mussels, scrubbed and debearded
Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add chorizo to pan; sauté 1 minute or until lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Remove rice from bags. Add rice to pan; sauté 1 minute, stirring frequently. Stir in salt, paprika, and pepper; sauté 30 seconds. Add 1 1/2 cups water and tomatoes; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer 10 minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is almost absorbed.
Stir in edamame. Nestle mussels into rice mixture. Cover and cook 4 minutes or until mussels open and liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat. Discard any unopened mussels.
Wine note: Think pink for paella. Crisp, dry Beckmen 2009 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Grenache Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley, $18) has vibrant red fruit and spice to cover the smoked paprika and chorizo. Great acidity keeps going with the tomatoes, and rich texture wraps around the mussels. --Sara Schneider
