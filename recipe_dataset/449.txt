Classic Lasagna
2  medium onions, chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
4  garlic cloves, minced
1 pound lean ground beef
1  (14.5-oz.) can basil, garlic, and oregano diced tomatoes
2  (6-oz.) cans tomato paste
1  (8-oz.) can basil, garlic, and oregano tomato sauce
1  bay leaf
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1¼ teaspoons salt, divided
¾ teaspoon pepper, divided
12  lasagna noodles, uncooked
8 cups boiling water
1  (16-oz.) container ricotta cheese
2  large eggs, lightly beaten
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
2  (6-oz.) packages part-skim mozzarella cheese slices
Garnish: chopped fresh parsley
Sauté onion in 1 Tbsp. hot oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat 5 minutes or until tender. Add garlic, and sauté 1 minute. Add beef, and cook, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes or until beef crumbles and is no longer pink. Drain beef mixture, and return to skillet. Stir in diced tomatoes, next 4 ingredients, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf; set meat sauce aside.
Place lasagna noodles in a 13- x- 9-inch pan. Carefully pour 8 cups boiling water and remaining 1 Tbsp. olive oil over noodles. Let stand 15 minutes.
Stir together ricotta cheese, eggs, Parmesan cheese, remaining 1/4 tsp. salt, and remaining 1/4 tsp. pepper until blended.
Spoon half of the meat sauce mixture in a lightly greased 13- x 9-inch baking dish. Shake excess water from noodles, and arrange 6 noodles over meat sauce; top with half of ricotta mixture and 1 package mozzarella cheese slices. Repeat layers once.
Bake, covered, at 350° for 55 minutes. Uncover and bake 10 to 15 more minutes or until bubbly. Let lasagna stand 10 minutes before serving. Garnish, if desired.
