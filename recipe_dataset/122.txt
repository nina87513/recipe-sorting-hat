Grilled Tofu With Spicy Peanut Sauce
2  14.5-oz. packages water-packed extra-firm tofu, drained
Grapeseed oil
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
½ teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon kosher salt
¼ cup loosely packed cilantro leaves
3 tablespoons salted peanuts
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1  clove garlic
1  red Fresno chili, seeded and chopped
2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger
1 teaspoon fresh lime juice
Preheat grill to high (450°F to 550°F). Cut each tofu block in half lengthwise to make 4 (about 1-inch-thick) slabs. Wrap each slab in several layers of paper towels or kitchen towels. Let stand 10 minutes to drain excess liquid. Remove towels. Lightly brush tofu with grapeseed oil. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar evenly over tofu. Sprinkle with pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.
Pulse cilantro, peanuts, olive oil, sesame oil, vinegar, garlic, chili, ginger, lime juice and remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor until finely chopped.
Generously oil grill grate with grapeseed oil. Grill tofu until grill marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Cut each slab into 3 triangles. Serve with peanut sauce.
