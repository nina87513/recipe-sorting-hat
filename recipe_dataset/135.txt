Bok Choy and Tofu Stir-Fry
1 pound baby bok choy
4 teaspoons vegetable oil
2  garlic cloves, chopped
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
5 ounces small fresh mushrooms, such as shiitake, button, beech, or enoki (cut into clumps), rinsed, tough parts of stems trimmed
7 ounces silken tofu, cut into 3/4-in. cubes
Â¼ teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine* or dry sherry
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
.13 teaspoon kosher salt
.13 teaspoon pepper
Trim bases of bok choy and separate outer leaves from stalks, leaving the smallest inner leaves attached. Rinse and thoroughly dry bok choy in a salad spinner.
Heat a wok or large frying pan (not nonstick) over medium-high heat until hot when you wave your hand over the bottom. Add vegetable oil, garlic, and ginger and stir once; then immediately add mushrooms and stir-fry until they just begin to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Toss tofu with 1/4 tsp. pepper and stir-fry tofu until it softens and starts to look custardy, 2 to 3 minutes.
Add rice wine and cook 30 seconds. Add bok choy leaves and stalks and cook, tossing with tongs, until beginning to wilt, about 1 minute. The wok may seem crowded, but the leaves wilt quite a bit.
Add soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and remaining pepper; cook, tossing often, until bok choy is tender-crisp, another 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.
