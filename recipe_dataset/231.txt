Butter or margarine, softened
Sugar
¼ cup butter or margarine
¼ cup all-purpose flour
1¼ cups milk

Grease bottom and sides of 8 (6-ounce) ramekins or custard cups evenly with butter. Lightly coat bottom and sides evenly with sugar, shaking out excess. Place ramekins in a 13- x 9-inch pan or baking dish. Set aside.
Melt 1/4 cup butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; whisk in flour. Cook, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, whisking constantly until thickened. Remove from heat. Whisk in 2/3 cup sugar and next 5 ingredients.
Beat egg yolks at high speed with an electric mixer 4 to 5 minutes or until thick and pale. Gradually whisk about one-fourth of hot mixture into yolks; add to remaining hot mixture, whisking constantly. Cook over medium heat 1 minute. Remove from heat; let stand 20 minutes.
Beat egg whites at high speed with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gently fold egg whites into milk mixture. Spoon evenly into each ramekin, filling to top.
Bake at 400° for 18 to 20 minutes or until puffed and set. Serve immediately with Lemon Whipped Cream.
