Baked Falafel Sandwiches with Yogurt-Tahini Sauce
Sauce:
1 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt (such as Fage Total Classic)
1 tablespoon tahini (sesame-seed paste)
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Falafel:
¾ cup water
¼ cup uncooked bulgur
3 cups cooked chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
½ cup chopped green onions
  to 1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon baking powder
¾ teaspoon salt
¼  to 1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper
3  garlic cloves
Cooking spray
Remaining ingredients:
6  (2.8-ounce) Mediterranean Style white flatbreads (such as Toufayan)
12  (1/4-inch-thick) slices tomato
Chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
To prepare sauce, combine the first 3 ingredients, stirring with a whisk until blended. Cover and chill until ready to serve.
To prepare falafel, bring 3/4 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan; add bulgur to pan. Remove from heat; cover and let stand 30 minutes or until tender. Drain and set aside.
Preheat oven to 425°.
Combine chickpeas and the next 9 ingredients (through garlic) in a food processor; pulse 10 times or until well blended and smooth (mixture will be wet). Spoon chickpea mixture into a large bowl; stir in bulgur.
Divide mixture into 12 equal portions (about 1/4 cup each); shape each portion into a 1/4-inch-thick patty. Place patties on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Bake at 425° for 10 minutes on each side or until browned. Spread about 2 1/2 tablespoons sauce onto each flatbread. Top each flatbread with 2 falafel patties, 2 tomato slices, and chopped cilantro, if desired.
