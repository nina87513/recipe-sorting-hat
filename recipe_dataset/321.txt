Greek Salad With Grilled Chicken
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon honey
¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
Olive oil cooking spray
12 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast
1½ pounds plum tomatoes, halved, seeded, and quartered (about 68 tomatoes)
½  large seedless cucumber, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
½  small red onion, thinly sliced
3 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
 cup pitted kalamata olives, halved
3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint, divided
4 cups torn romaine lettuce
Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, and honey. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper; set aside.
Heat a grill pan to high. Lightly coat chicken with olive oil spray, and season with remaining salt and pepper; cook over high heat 2 minutes per side or until just cooked through. Transfer to a cutting board; let stand 5 minutes.
In a serving bowl, toss tomatoes, cucumber, onion, feta, olives, and half the mint with vinaigrette. Slice chicken into 1/2-inch strips, add to salad, and toss gently. Place 1 cup romaine on each of 4 plates, top with chicken mixture and remaining mint.
