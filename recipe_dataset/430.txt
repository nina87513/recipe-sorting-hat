Grape Raita
2 cups plain 2% reduced-fat Greek yogurt
½ cup 1% low-fat milk
1½ cups seedless red grapes, halved
2 teaspoons roasted ground cumin
1 teaspoon sugar
¼ teaspoon ground red pepper
3 tablespoons canola oil
2 teaspoons black or brown mustard seeds or cumin seeds
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
6  fresh or frozen curry leaves, torn into pieces (optional)
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
Combine yogurt and milk in a medium bowl, stirring well with a whisk until smooth.
Stir in grapes, cumin, sugar, and pepper. Combine oil and mustard seeds or cumin seeds in a small skillet over medium-high heat; cook until cumin darkens or mustard seeds crackle (1 to 2 minutes), stirring frequently. (Cover pan if using mustard seeds.) Add fennel seeds and curry leaves, if desired; cook, uncovered, 10 more seconds, stirring. Pour oil mixture over yogurt mixture; chill completely (about 1 hour). Stir in salt before serving.
