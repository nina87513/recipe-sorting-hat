Bouillabaisse Fondue
12  to 18 red thin-skinned potatoes (1 1/2 in. wide), scrubbed
½ pound boned, skinned firm-flesh fish such as halibut
½ pound sea scallops
½  pound shrimp (31 to 40 per lb.), shelled and deveined
Bouillabaisse broth
Rouille
Croutons
In a 3- to 4-quart pan over high heat, bring about 1 quart water to a boil. Add potatoes. Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain; keep warm.
Meanwhile, rinse fish, scallops, and shrimp; pat dry. Cut fish into 1/4-inch-thick slices about 2 inches long. Cut scallops crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut shrimp in half lengthwise. Arrange fish, scallops, and shrimp on a flat dish.
In a 3-quart metal chafing dish or pan over high heat, bring all the broth to a boil. If using a 2-quart fondue pan, fill it halfway with boiling broth (keep remaining broth hot; cover and set over lowest heat on a range).
Set container over an ignited alcohol or canned solid-fuel flame. Adjust for maximum heat. Place potatoes, seafood, rouille, and croutons alongside.
Spear potatoes or seafood, 1 piece at a time, on fondue forks or thin skewers (metal or wood) and immerse in broth. Cook potatoes until warm or hot, and seafood until barely opaque in thickest part, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Dip hot foods into rouille to taste, or spread rouille onto croutons to eat. If broth stops simmering, return to high heat on a range burner until boiling. Return to fondue burner. As broth in 2-quart pan evaporates, add remaining broth.
When potatoes and seafood are consumed, ladle cooking broth into bowls. Spread any remaining croutons with remaining rouille; eat while sipping broth.
