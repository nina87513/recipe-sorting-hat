Asian Chicken Lettuce Wraps
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 tablespoon dark sesame oil
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
1½ teaspoons chili garlic sauce (such as Sriracha)
1 teaspoon grated peeled fresh ginger
½ teaspoon grated orange rind
2  garlic cloves, minced
Dash of sea salt
4  (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
Cooking spray
8  Boston lettuce leaves (about 1 head)
1 cup fresh mint leaves (about 10 ounces)
½ cup bean sprouts (about 2 ounces)
1  lime, cut into 8 wedges
Chopped peanuts (optional)
Combine first 9 ingredients in a small bowl; stir with a whisk. Reserve 2 tablespoons oil mixture. Place remaining oil mixture in a large zip-top plastic bag. Add chicken breast halves; seal and marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour, turning occasionally. Remove chicken from bag, and discard marinade.
Heat a large nonstick grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add chicken to pan; grill 12 minutes or until chicken is done, turning once. Let stand 5 minutes before thinly slicing. Divide chicken evenly among lettuce leaves; top each lettuce leaf with 2 tablespoons mint, 1 tablespoon sprouts, and about 1 teaspoon reserved oil mixture. Serve with lime wedges. Garnish with chopped peanuts, if desired.
