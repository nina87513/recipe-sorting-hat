Lamb Shanks On Lentil-Spinach Ragoût
6  (1-pound) lamb shanks, trimmed
½ teaspoon pepper
¼ teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup dry red wine
½ cup beef broth
4  carrots, scraped and sliced
2  celery stalks, sliced
1  (28-ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes, undrained
1½ teaspoons dried rosemary leaves
2  bay leaves
3  slices center-cut bacon
2  (19-ounce) cans lentil soup (such as Progresso)
¾ cup tomato juice
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1  (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
Sprinkle lamb with pepper and salt. Heat an extra-large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half of lamb; cook 3 minutes on each side or until browned. Remove from pan; set aside. Repeat with remaining lamb. Reduce heat to medium; add onion and next 4 ingredients. Cook 5 minutes, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Add tomatoes, rosemary, and bay leaves. Return lamb to pan. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours or until lamb is tender; discard bay leaves and liquid.
Cook bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Remove bacon from pan, and crumble. Discard pan drippings. Add bacon, soup, and remaining 3 ingredients to pan. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Serve lamb shanks on a bed of lentil ragoût.
NOTE: The discarded remaining braising liquid can be used to make a delicious soup; just skim the fat first.
