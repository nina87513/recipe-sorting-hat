Meaty Soft Tacos
12  corn tortillas
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 cups meat-loaf mixture
½ pound green cabbage (half a small head)
2  medium tomatoes
1  bunch fresh cilantro
Hot sauce (optional)
Wrap tortillas in aluminum foil and place in a 350° F oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meat-loaf mixture and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Shred cabbage and chop tomatoes. Wash and dry cilantro. Fill each tortilla with some ground meat. Top with the cabbage, tomatoes, and cilantro leaves. Serve with bottled hotsauce, if desired.
