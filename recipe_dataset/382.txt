Curried Vegetable Samosas with Cilantro-Mint Chutney
Chutney:
½ cup fresh cilantro leaves
½ cup fresh mint leaves
¼ cup chopped red onion
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon water
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
.13 teaspoon sugar
1  serrano chile, coarsely chopped
1  (1/2-inch) piece peeled fresh ginger
Samosas:
1¼ cups mashed cooked peeled baking potatoes
¼ cup cooked yellow lentils
1 tablespoon minced fresh mint
1 teaspoon Madras curry powder
1 teaspoon butter, softened
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon ground cumin
½ cup frozen petite green peas, thawed
10  egg roll wrappers
1  large egg, lightly beaten
Cooking spray
To prepare chutney, combine first 9 ingredients in a blender; process until smooth. Set aside.
To prepare samosas, combine potatoes, lentils, mint, curry powder, 1 teaspoon butter, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and cumin. Gently fold in peas.
Working with 1 egg roll wrapper at a time (cover remaining wrappers to prevent drying), cut down middle to form 2 long rectangles. Moisten edges of wrapper with egg. Spoon 1 tablespoon potato mixture near bottom edge of wrapper. Fold up from 1 corner to the opposite outer edge of the wrapper, making a triangle. Fold over to opposite side again as if folding up a flag. Repeat fold to opposite side to form a triangle. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Lightly coat samosas with cooking spray. Add samosas to pan, and cook 1 minute on each side. Drain on paper towels. Serve with chutney.
