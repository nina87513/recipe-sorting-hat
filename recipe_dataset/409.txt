Samosas
2 tablespoons canola oil
½ teaspoon cumin seeds
¼ teaspoon mustard seeds
½ cup finely chopped onion
½ teaspoon peeled, minced fresh ginger
1½ teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
2 cups Yukon gold potatoes (about 1 pound)  cooked, peeled, and diced
½ cup frozen green peas, thawed
4 sheets phyllo dough
Preheat oven to 400° F. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, then add the cumin and mustard seeds. Cook for 1 minute or until the seeds begin to brown. Stir in the onion and sauté 3 to 4 minutes or until tender. Stir in the ginger, curry powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook about 45 seconds. Add the potatoes and mash lightly with a fork. Stir in the peas and the remaining salt and cook until the mixture is warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from stove and cool slightly. Place 1 sheet of phyllo dough on a flat surface and brush with some of the remaining oil. Top with another sheet of phyllo and brush again with the oil. Cut the dough into 6 squares. Place 3 generous tablespoons of the potato mixture into the center of each square and flatten slightly with your fingers. Fold the dough over the potatoes as if you are wrapping a package; brush them with more oil and lay them seam-side down on a nonstick baking sheet. Repeat with the 5 remaining dough squares. Take another 2 sheets of phyllo and repeat the process to form 6 more packages. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve immediately.
