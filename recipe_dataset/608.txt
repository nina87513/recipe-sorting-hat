Chicken Tortilla Soup
6 cups chicken broth
1  14.5-ounce can diced or crushed tomatoes, undrained
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Six  6-inch corn tortillas, cut into strips 1/2 inch wide and 2 to 3 inches long
2  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves or 3 thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
1  onion, chopped
2  cloves garlic, finely chopped
2  jalapeños, seeded and minced
½ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon kosher or sea salt
½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
Chopped  fresh cilantro
1  lime, cut into 6 wedges
Combine broth and tomatoes in a soup pot, and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and let simmer 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add tortilla strips in a couple of batches and cook, stirring once or twice, until light brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove fried strips to paper towels to drain.
In same skillet, cook chicken 3 to 5 minutes without stirring, until nicely browned on first side. Add onion, garlic, jalapeños, cumin, and salt; cook 5 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are softened.
Add contents of skillet to simmering broth; cook 10 minutes.
Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish each with tortilla strips, cheese, and cilantro; serve each bowl with a wedge of lime.
