Chicken Enchiladas
4 cups cold water
2 cups fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
5  garlic cloves, crushed
2  (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1  celery stalk, coarsely chopped
1  large carrot, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1  jalapeño pepper, halved
½  medium onion, cut into wedges
1  (7-ounce) can salsa verde
¼ cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup chopped seeded tomato
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon ground cumin
¼ teaspoon ground red pepper
4 ounces 1/3-less-fat cream cheese, softened
12  (6-inch) corn tortillas
Cooking spray
1 ounce sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (about 1/4 cup)
Combine first 9 ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Cook 8 minutes or until chicken is done. Remove chicken from pan with a slotted spoon; let stand 10 minutes. Shred the chicken; set aside. Drain cooking liquid through a sieve over a bowl; reserve liquid. Discard solids.
Combine the reserved cooking liquid and salsa verde in a saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until reduced to 1 1/2 cups (about 30 minutes). Reduce heat to low; stir in whipping cream. Place pan over low heat.
Preheat oven to 400°.
Place chicken in a medium bowl. Add tomato and next 5 ingredients (through cream cheese) to chicken; toss. Dip each tortilla in sauce mixture for 10 seconds. Fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup chicken mixture; roll up. Arrange filled tortillas, seam sides down, in an 11 x 7inch glass or ceramic baking dish coated with cooking spray. Spoon sauce over tortillas; top with cheddar cheese. Bake at 400° for 20 minutes or until lightly browned.
