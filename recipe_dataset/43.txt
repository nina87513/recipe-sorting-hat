Lettuce Wraps with Hoisin-Peanut Sauce
Sauce:
1 teaspoon canola oil
1 tablespoon minced shallot
 cup water
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
4 teaspoons hoisin sauce
.13 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
Filling:
1  (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and crumbled
1 tablespoon dark sesame oil
6  thinly sliced green onions (about 2/3 cup), divided
½ cup plus 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided
3 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons sugar
½ teaspoon Sriracha (hot chile sauce, such as Huy Fong)
1 cup matchstick-cut cucumbers
1 cup matchstick-cut carrots
2 cups hot cooked sticky rice
8  Bibb lettuce leaves
To prepare sauce, heat a small saucepan over medium heat. Add canola oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add shallot, and sauté for 2 minutes. Add 1/3 cup water and next 3 ingredients (through red pepper), and stir with a whisk. Bring to a boil; cook 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in lime juice.
To prepare filling, spread crumbled tofu in a single layer on several layers of paper towels; cover with additional paper towels. Let stand 20 minutes, pressing down occasionally.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add sesame oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add 1/3 cup green onions; sauté 1 minute. Add tofu; sauté for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 2 tablespoons cilantro, soy sauce, ginger, sugar, and Sriracha; sauté 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in cucumbers, carrots, and remaining green onions.
Spoon 1/4 cup rice into each lettuce leaf. Top with about 1/2 cup tofu mixture; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon cilantro. Serve with sauce.
