Cajun Catfish
4  (4-ounce) farm-raised catfish fillets
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
4 teaspoons Cajun Seasoning
Vegetable cooking spray
Lemon wedges (optional)
Brush both sides of fillets with lemon juice, and sprinkle with Cajun Seasoning. Place fish on a broiler pan coated with cooking spray, and broil 5 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Serve with lemon wedges, if desired.
