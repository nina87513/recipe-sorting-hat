Lamb and Sausage Cassoulet
1 cup dried Great Northern beans
3 cups boiling water
2 teaspoons olive oil
8 ounces boneless leg of lamb, trimmed and cut into bite-sized pieces
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
4 ounces turkey kielbasa, chopped
1  slice bacon, chopped
1½ cups coarsely chopped onion
1 cup coarsely chopped carrot (about 2 medium)
½ cup coarsely chopped celery
6  garlic cloves, smashed
1 tablespoon no-salt-added tomato paste
2½ cups fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
1½ cups water
2 tablespoons brandy
1  (2-ounce) piece French bread baguette
¼ cup (1 ounce) grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
Preheat oven to 350°.
Sort and wash beans; place in a large saucepan. Cover beans with 3 cups boiling water. Cover and let stand 1 hour. Drain; set beans aside.
Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Sprinkle lamb evenly with pepper and salt. Add lamb to pan; sauté 5 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. Add lamb to beans.
Return pan to medium-high heat. Add sausage and bacon to pan; sauté 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add onion and next 3 ingredients (through garlic) to pan; sauté 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add onion mixture to bean mixture. Add tomato paste to pan; sauté 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Stir in broth, 1 1/2 cups water, and brandy; bring to a boil, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Stir bean mixture into broth mixture. Cover and bake at 350° for 1 hour. Uncover; bake 1 hour, uncovered.
Tear bread into small pieces. Combine torn bread and grated cheese in a food processor; process until coarse crumbs measure 2 cups. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture evenly over bean mixture. Bake an additional 30 minutes or until topping is golden brown and beans are tender. Sprinkle mixture with chopped fresh parsley.
