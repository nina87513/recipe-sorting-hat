Pork Roulade
1  (1-pound) pork tenderloin
1 tablespoon olive oil
 cup chopped parsley
2 tablespoons chopped chives
½ teaspoon chopped rosemary
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
Preheat oven to 425°. Slice pork tenderloin lengthwise, cutting to, but not through, other side. Open halves. Place between sheets of plastic wrap; pound to 1/2 inch. Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, parsley, chives, and rosemary; spread on pork. Roll, starting with long side. Secure pork with picks. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat a large ovenproof pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and pork; cook for 6 minutes, browning all sides. Bake at 425° for 12 minutes or until a thermometer registers 145°. Remove pork; let stand 5 minutes. Slice.
