Shredded Chicken Tacos
 cup sliced shallots
½ cup unsalted chicken stock
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
¾ teaspoon ground cumin, divided
.63 teaspoon smoked paprika
2  (4-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken thighs
5  garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1  (15-ounce) can unsalted pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1½ cups thinly sliced red cabbage
¼ cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, divided
1 teaspoon canola oil
2 tablespoons pepitas (toasted pumpkinseeds)
 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
1  ripe avocado, peeled
8  corn tortillas
Combine shallots, stock, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, paprika, chicken, and garlic in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 15 minutes. Remove chicken from pan; set aside. Increase heat to medium; cook 8 minutes or until liquid is reduced to about 2 to 3 tablespoons. Shred chicken with 2 forks; stir chicken and beans into cooking liquid. Mash some of the beans to thicken and bind the mixture.
While chicken cooks, combine cabbage, cilantro, 1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice, oil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; toss well to combine. Sprinkle with pepitas.
Combine yogurt, avocado, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons lime juice, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl; mash to desired consistency.
Heat tortillas directly over a gas flame or in a hot cast-iron skillet for 20 seconds on each side or until lightly charred. Divide chicken mixture, slaw, and avocado mixture evenly among tortillas.
