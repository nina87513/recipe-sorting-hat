Mint-and-Pea Hummus on Flatbread
1 pound fresh or frozen green peas
 cup tahini
¼ cup fresh mint leaves
1 pinch kosher salt
10  flatbread crackers
Bring 3 inches of water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add peas, and cook until just tender (about 2 minutes); drain and cool slightly. In a food processor, combine cooked peas, tahini, and mint leaves; purée until chunky-smooth. Add a pinch of kosher salt, and serve with flatbread crackers broken into thirds.
