Lime-Cilantro Pork Tacos
1 pound pork tenderloin, trimmed and cut into thin strips
¼ teaspoon salt
.13 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons olive oil
1½ cups thinly sliced onion
1  small jalapeño pepper, seeded and chopped
½ cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
½ cup chopped plum tomato
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
2½ tablespoons fresh lime juice
8  (6-inch) flour tortillas
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle pork with salt and black pepper. Add oil to pan. Add pork, and sauté 4 minutes or until browned. Remove pork from pan; place in a bowl. Add onion and jalapeño to pan; sauté 5 minutes or until tender. Add broth; reduce heat, and simmer 1 minute, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Stir in tomato; simmer 2 minutes.
Return pork and accumulated juices to pan. Stir in cilantro and lime juice; cook 1 minute or until pork is done.
Heat tortillas according to package directions. Spoon 1/2 cup pork mixture into each tortilla; roll up.
