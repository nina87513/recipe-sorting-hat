Shredded Pork and Pinto Tacos with Pepita Slaw
 cup sliced shallots
½ cup unsalted chicken stock
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
¾ teaspoon ground cumin, divided
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
8 ounces pork tenderloin, trimmed and cut in half crosswise
5  garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1  (15-ounce) can unsalted pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1½ cups thinly sliced red cabbage
¼ cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, divided
1 teaspoon canola oil
2 tablespoons pepitas (toasted pumpkinseeds)
 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
1  ripe avocado, peeled
8  corn tortillas
Combine shallots, stock, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, paprika, pork, and garlic in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 25 minutes. Remove pork from pan; set aside. Increase heat to medium; cook 8 minutes or until liquid is reduced to about 2 to 3 tablespoons. Shred pork with 2 forks; stir pork and beans into cooking liquid. Mash some of the beans to thicken and bind the mixture.
While pork cooks, combine cabbage, cilantro, 1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice, oil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; toss well to combine. Sprinkle with pepitas.
Combine yogurt, avocado, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons lime juice, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl; mash to desired consistency.
Heat tortillas directly over a gas flame or in a hot cast-iron skillet for 20 seconds on each side or until lightly charred. Divide pork mixture, slaw, and avocado mixture evenly among tortillas.
Shredded Chicken Taco Variation: In place of pork tenderloin, use 2 (4-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken thighs. Decrease simmering time from 25 to 15 minutes, and increase smoked paprika to 5/8 teaspoon.
