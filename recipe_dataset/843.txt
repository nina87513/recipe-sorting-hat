Pita Salad with Tomatoes, Cucumber, and Herbs
3  (7-inch) pitas
4 cups coarsely chopped romaine lettuce
2 cups diced English cucumber
2 cups halved cherry tomatoes
 cup (3 ounces) crumbled feta cheese
½ cup finely chopped red onion
½ cup chopped fresh mint
¼ cup thinly sliced green onions
¼ cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
Preheat oven to 375°.
Arrange pitas on a baking sheet. Bake at 375° for 14 minutes or until dry and crisp, turning after 7 minutes. Set aside; cool.
Combine lettuce and next 7 ingredients (through parsley) in a large bowl. Break pitas into bite-sized pieces. Add pitas to salad; toss gently to combine.
Combine juice, sugar, pepper, and salt in a bowl; gradually add oil, stirring constantly with a whisk. Drizzle dressing over salad; toss well to coat. Let stand 30 minutes; serve at room temperature.
