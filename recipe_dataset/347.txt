Grilled Flank Steak Gyros
1  (1-pound) flank steak
½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
½ teaspoon garlic powder, divided
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
Cooking spray
½ cup peeled shredded cucumber
1  (7-ounce) container plain 2% reduced-fat Greek yogurt
 cup vertically sliced red onion
 cup coarsely chopped fresh dill
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
4  (1.5-ounce) flatbread pockets (such as Toufayan SmartPockets)
4  (1/4-inch-thick) tomato slices, halved
Preheat the grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.
Sprinkle steak evenly with 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place steak on grill rack coated with cooking spray; grill 10 minutes or until desired degree of doneness, turning after 6 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut steak diagonally into thin slices.
Place shredded cucumber in paper towels; gently squeeze to release moisture. Stir cucumber, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper into yogurt.
Combine onion, dill, oil, and juice in a bowl; toss to coat.
Divide steak evenly among flatbread pockets; top each with about 2 table­spoons yogurt mixture, 1/4 cup onion mixture, and 1 halved tomato slice.
