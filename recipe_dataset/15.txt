Quick Baked Beans with Smoked Bacon
6 ounces thin-sliced apple wood- smoked or regular bacon (about 6 slices), cut into 3/4-inch pieces
2  onions (about 1 lb. total), peeled and chopped
3  cans (28 oz. each) Boston-style baked beans
½ cup catsup
2 tablespoons firmly packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon dry mustard
In a 5- to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat, stir bacon often until browned and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Discard all but 1 1/2 tablespoons fat in pan.
Add onions to pan and stir often until they begin to brown and stick to bottom of pan, 7 to 9 minutes. Add beans and their liquid, catsup, brown sugar, dry mustard, and cooked bacon; mix well. Pour into a shallow 3-quart casserole.
Bake, uncovered, in a 350° regular or convection oven until beans are bubbling in the center, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve hot.
