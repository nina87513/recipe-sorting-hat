Chicken Tacos with Corn Salsa
1 15-oz  can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 10-oz  can diced tomatoes with green chilies, drained
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, plus extra for garnish
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
Salt and pepper
4  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons olive oil
2  large ears of corn, shucked
8  taco-sized soft flour tortillas, warmed
Preheat a gas grill to medium. Mix beans, tomatoes and cilantro in a medium bowl.
In a small bowl, combine chili and garlic powders, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Drizzle chicken with 1 Tbsp olive oil and rub with spice blend. Drizzle corn with remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Grill corn until lightly charred, 5 to 6 minutes, turning twice. Remove to a plate. Grill chicken until cooked through, 9 to 10 minutes, flipping once. Slice chicken into strips.
Once corn has cooled slightly, slice of kernels and stir into bean-tomato mixture. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
Divide salsa and chicken among tortillas and serve immediately.
