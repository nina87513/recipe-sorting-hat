Moussaka
2  small eggplants (about 3/4 pound each)
Olive-oil flavored vegetable cooking spray
1 pound lean ground lamb (or ground round)
1  (27 1/2-ounce) jar fat-free chunky spaghetti sauce with mushrooms
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon pepper
1  (10 3/4-ounce) can reduced-fat, reduced-sodium cream of mushroom soup
 cup water
2 tablespoons fine, dry breadcrumbs
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
Peel eggplants, and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place on a large baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Coat slices with cooking spray. Bake at 375° for 25 minutes or until eggplant is tender and lightly browned, turning once. Let cool slightly.
Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; place over medium-high heat until hot. Add meat, and cook until browned, stirring until it crumbles. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Wipe drippings from skillet with a paper towel.
Return meat to skillet; add spaghetti sauce, cinnamon, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes or until meat mixture is thickened, stirring occasionally.
Coat an 11- x 7- x 1 1/2-inch baking dish with cooking spray; place half of eggplant slices in dish; top with half of meat mixture. Repeat layers with remaining eggplant slices and remaining meat mixture. Combine soup and water in a medium bowl, stirring until smooth; pour over meat mixture. Combine breadcrumbs and cheese in a small bowl. Sprinkle crumb mixture over soup mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 375° for 25 minutes or until browned and bubbly.
