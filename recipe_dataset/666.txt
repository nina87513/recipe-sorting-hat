Tostadas with Shredded Pork (Tostadas de Tinga)
Vegetable oil for frying
2  dozen corn tortillas (5 to 6 in. wide; see notes)
2  quarts finely shredded cabbage (1 1/4 lb.)
½ cup thinly sliced radishes
 cup lime juice
Salt and pepper
6 cups hot refried black or pinto beans (purchased or homemade)
Shredded pork
About 1 1/2 cups chipotle salsa
About 1 1/2 cups sour cream, Mexican crema, or crème fraîche
8 ounces queso fresco or farmer's cheese, crumbled (see notes)
2  avocados (8 oz. each), peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced, or 2 to 3 cups guacamole
Pour 1/2 inch oil into an 8- to 10-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. When the edge of a tortilla bubbles vigorously when dipped in the oil, slip tortilla into pan. Cook tortilla, pushing down into oil occasionally and turning over once, until lightly browned, about 1 minute total. Lift out with tongs and transfer to paper towel-lined baking sheets to drain. Repeat to cook remaining tortillas; set in a single layer. As they cool, stack.
In a bowl, mix cabbage, radishes, and lime juice. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Spoon cabbage mixture, refried beans, shredded pork, chipotle salsa, sour cream, cheese, and avocados into separate bowls. Serve with crisp-fried tortillas for guests to assemble their own tostadas: Spread beans on a tortilla, then add pork, cabbage, salsa, sour cream, cheese, and avocado to taste.
