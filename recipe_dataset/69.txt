Beef and Broccoli Stir-fry
1 pound pre-cut beef for stir-fry
2  garlic cloves, smashed
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1  bunch broccoli (about 1 lb.)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
½ cup water
1½ cups beef broth
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup fresh mung bean sprouts
Combine beef, garlic, ginger and soy sauce in a bowl and let stand.
Wash broccoli thoroughly and cut into florets. Trim and peel stems and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices.
Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over high heat, add broccoli florets and stems, then stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and stir until water evaporates. Transfer broccoli to a plate.
Add remaining oil to pan, add beef mixture and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Stir together broth and cornstarch, add to meat and stir-fry until sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes longer. Add broccoli and bean sprouts, then cook, stirring, until heated through, about 2 minutes.
