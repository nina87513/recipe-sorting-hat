Arroz Con Pollo (Chicken With Rice)
3 cups water
½ teaspoon black peppercorns
3  bay leaves
2 pounds chicken thighs, skinned
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cups coarsely chopped yellow onion
1½ cups coarsely chopped green bell pepper
3  garlic cloves, finely chopped
1½ cups uncooked Arborio rice
1 tablespoon Hungarian sweet paprika
Dash of crushed saffron threads
½ cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
Combine the first 4 ingredients in a large Dutch oven, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat.
Remove chicken thighs from broth. Strain broth through a colander into a bowl, and discard solids. Add enough water to broth to equal 3 cups, and set broth mixture aside.
Remove the chicken from bones, and cut meat into bite-size pieces. Discard bones.
Heat the oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic; sauté 6 minutes or until lightly browned. Add rice, paprika, and saffron; cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the broth mixture, wine, salt, and pepper; cook 6 minutes or until half of liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally. Stir in chicken. Cover and bake at 325° for 12 minutes or until rice is just tender and liquid is nearly absorbed. Sprinkle each serving with chopped parsley.
