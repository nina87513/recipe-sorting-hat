1  can (15 oz.) chickpeas (garbanzo) beans, drained
1 cup salted and roasted cashews, plus 4 to 6 for garnish
About 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. sea salt (depends upon saltiness of cashews)
1  small bunch cilantro (about 2.5 oz.)
Zest of one medium lime
Â½ cup olive oil
About 2 tbsp. lime juice
Pinch of cayenne pepper
Mixed raw and/or blanched vegetables, cut into sticks or halved
Put chickpeas, cashews, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 2/3 cup water in a food processor and pulse until very smooth.
