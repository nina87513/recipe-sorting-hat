Tempura Dill Pickles
1  (24-ounce) jar sliced kosher dill pickles
Vegetable oil
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground red pepper
¼ teaspoon salt
1 cup club soda, chilled
Drain pickles, reserving 2 tablespoons pickle juice. Press pickles between layers of paper towels. Set aside.
Pour oil to a depth of 3 inches into a Dutch oven; heat to 370°.
Combine flour and next 3 ingredients in a medium bowl. Stir in club soda and reserved 2 tablespoons pickle juice, stirring just until combined. (Batter will be lumpy.)
Dip pickles into batter, letting excess drip off.
Fry pickles, in batches, 2 1/2 minutes or until golden brown. Drain on wire racks over paper towels, and serve immediately.
