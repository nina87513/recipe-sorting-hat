Fried Chicken Tacos
¼ cup fresh lime juice
Kosher salt
4  (about 5 ounces each) large boneless chicken thighs with skin, pounded 1/3 inch thick
½ pound tomatillos, husked and quartered
2  garlic cloves, chopped
2  serrano chiles or 1 large jalapeño with seeds, chopped
1  small onion, coarsely chopped
3 tablespoons cilantro leaves
1  Hass avocado, cut into 1/2-inch dice
 cup all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Large cayenne pepper
Vegetable oil, for frying
Warm corn tortillas, for serving
In a large bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the lime juice with 1 teaspoon of salt, stirring to dissolve the salt. Add the chicken thighs and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
In a food processor, combine the tomatillos, garlic, serranos, onion and cilantro and process to a coarse puree. Transfer the salsa to a bowl and stir in the avocado and the remaining 2 tablespoons of lime juice. Season with salt.
Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour with the pepper, cayenne and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
In a large skillet, heat 1/3 inch of oil until shimmering. Dredge the chicken in the flour, shaking off any excess. Fry the chicken over moderately high heat until well-browned and crisp, about 3 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
Cut the chicken into thin strips and serve with the tomatillo salsa and warm corn tortillas.
