Steak & Mushroom Pizza-Dillas
Cooking spray
8 ounces top sirloin steak, trimmed and very thinly sliced
.38 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1 tablespoon butter
2  garlic cloves, minced
1  (8-ounce) container presliced cremini mushrooms
4 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded and divided (about 1 cup)
4  (8-inch) whole-wheat flour tortillas
1 cup lower-sodium marinara sauce (such as Dell'Amore), warmed
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add steak to pan; sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon salt. Cook 3 minutes or until browned, stirring occasionally. Place steak in a medium bowl.
Add butter to pan; swirl until butter melts. Add remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, garlic, and mushrooms; cook 6 minutes or until mushrooms brown and liquid evaporates, stirring occasionally. Add mushrooms to steak; toss to combine.
Wipe pan clean with paper towels. Reduce heat to medium. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons cheese evenly over half of each tortilla. Divide steak mixture evenly among tortillas; sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Fold tortillas in half over filling. Carefully coat both sides of quesadillas with cooking spray. Place 2 quesadillas in pan; cook 2 minutes on each side or until browned and cheese melts. Repeat with remaining quesadillas. Cut each into 4 wedges. Serve with marinara.
